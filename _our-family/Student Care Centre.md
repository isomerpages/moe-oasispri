### YMCA Student Care Centre (SCC) @ Oasis

At YMCA SCCs, our aim to provide a holistic education that focuses on character development and ensures that our children learn to look beyond themselves & care for others in the community.  

  

We place added emphasis on every child’s values and character development because we believe it is essential and critical in a child’s development. This is in line with the school’s mission of “building a community of learners- inspiring self and others to lead with a heart.”

### Programmes

*   Supervised Study Time
*   Character Development
*   Enrichment & Holiday Programmes
*   Fitness & Outdoor Programmes

### Our Activities

1.  **Showing our support during Covid-19 Circuit Breaker**

As a form of encouragement to the frontline workers such as healthcare workers, the students made a “thank you” note to them for their dedication and commitment during this challenging period.

  

We also took part in a community event which aimed to show our appreciation to the heroes who contributed greatly in the fight against the pandemic. The students, together with the teachers have designed and painted the Singa mascot. It was painted in gold with white and red colours to symbolise our national flag. There was also a ‘moving heart’ to imply our heroes’ selfless contributions.
