### YMCA Student Care Centre (SCC) @ Oasis

At YMCA SCCs, our aim to provide a holistic education that focuses on character development and ensures that our children learn to look beyond themselves & care for others in the community.  

We place added emphasis on every child’s values and character development because we believe it is essential and critical in a child’s development. This is in line with the school’s mission of “building a community of learners- inspiring self and others to lead with a heart.”

### Our Activities

**1. Showing our support during Covid-19 Circuit Breaker**

As a form of encouragement to the frontline workers such as healthcare workers, the students made a “thank you” note to them for their dedication and commitment during this challenging period.

We also took part in a community event which aimed to show our appreciation to the heroes who contributed greatly in the fight against the pandemic. The students, together with the teachers have designed and painted the Singa mascot. It was painted in gold with white and red colours to symbolise our national flag. There was also a ‘moving heart’ to imply our heroes’ selfless contributions.

**2. Seed Kindness Fund (SKF)**

The theme for this year SKF is to appreciate our front line heroes, who has been tirelessly working around the clock to fight against the ongoing pandemic crisis.

The students created a poster using cardboard recyclable materials. They used their creativity to design and wrote their heartfelt appreciation messages to our front line heroes. This project encouraged our children to be kind and considerate, and to heighten public awareness towards such acts of kindness.

 **3. Outdoor Time**


Students look forward to outdoor time every afternoon. Students get to relax and spend some quality time playing with their friends. The students played their favourite games such as ‘What time is it Mr Wolf?’, ‘Catching’, or ‘Ice and Water’. Students also played team sports like Basketball and Soccer. Abiding social distancing measure, students played these games in groups of five, observing 2 meters distance apart when in the field or indoor basketball court. Students thoroughly enjoyed themselves sweating it out and laughing it off with their friends.

**5. Thematic Learning**

This school holiday season, we are encouraging the children to showcase their talents through craft work. We explored “Flowers" as our theme for the holiday week. The children were enthusiastic and shared their knowledge on the different flowers of the season. They learnt about the different types of flowers and the different regions flowers grow in. We consolidated our learning with a craft activity. The students had a fun time designing, tracing, and cutting colour papers to create a beautiful flower.

**6. Craft Making Workshop**

During the December holidays, students were also taught how to create their own flowerpot at our hands-on workshop. This was in line with the theme of Flowers for that very week. This workshop would help to pique the children's interest in flowers by showing them how to construct their very own flower stalks. Students were taught how to use plasticine to create the parts of a flower, rolling the materials into flower buds and using various tools to mould each bud into a flower. Students then placed their flower creations into a flower pot. The instructors encouraged them to decorate the flowerpots with decorum of their own design. Children used the materials to create various sorts of embellishments for their own flowerpots, from commonplace additions such as leaves and rocks to more complex work such as caterpillars circling the flowerpot and butterflies perched on the flowers. The workshop was a great success, as it allowed children to learn about flowers and to hone their arts and craft skills.
