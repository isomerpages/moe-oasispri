<h3><strong>YMCA Student Care Centre (SCC) @ Oasis</strong></h3>
<p>At YMCA SCCs, our aim to provide a holistic education that focuses on
character development and ensures that our children learn to look beyond
themselves &amp; care for others in the community.</p>
<p>We place added emphasis on every child’s values and character development
because we believe it is essential and critical in a child’s development.
This is in line with the school’s mission of “building a community of learners-
inspiring self and others to lead with a heart.”</p>

<h3><strong>Our Activities</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1. Showing our support during Covid-19 Circuit Breaker</strong></h4>
<p>As a form of encouragement to the frontline workers such as healthcare
workers, the students made a “thank you” note to them for their dedication
and commitment during this challenging period.</p>
<p>We also took part in a community event which aimed to show our appreciation
to the heroes who contributed greatly in the fight against the pandemic.
The students, together with the teachers have designed and painted the
Singa mascot. It was painted in gold with white and red colours to symbolise
our national flag. There was also a ‘moving heart’ to imply our heroes’
selfless contributions.</p>

<h4><strong>2. Seed Kindness Fund (SKF)</strong></h4>
<p>The theme for this year SKF is to appreciate our front line heroes, who
has been tirelessly working around the clock to fight against the ongoing
pandemic crisis.</p>
<p>The students created a poster using cardboard recyclable materials. They
used their creativity to design and wrote their heartfelt appreciation
messages to our front line heroes. This project encouraged our children
to be kind and considerate, and to heighten public awareness towards such
acts of kindness.</p>

<h4><strong>3. Outdoor Time</strong></h4>
<p>Students look forward to outdoor time every afternoon. Students get to
relax and spend some quality time playing with their friends. The students
played their favourite games such as ‘What time is it Mr Wolf?’, ‘Catching’,
or ‘Ice and Water’. Students also played team sports like Basketball and
Soccer. Abiding social distancing measure, students played these games
in groups of five, observing 2 meters distance apart when in the field
or indoor basketball court. Students thoroughly enjoyed themselves sweating
it out and laughing it off with their friends.</p>

<h4><strong>5. Thematic Learning</strong></h4>
<p>This school holiday season, we are encouraging the children to showcase
their talents through craft work. We explored “Flowers" as our theme for
the holiday week. The children were enthusiastic and shared their knowledge
on the different flowers of the season. They learnt about the different
types of flowers and the different regions flowers grow in. We consolidated
our learning with a craft activity. The students had a fun time designing,
tracing, and cutting colour papers to create a beautiful flower.</p>

<h4><strong>6. Craft Making Workshop</strong></h4>
<p>During the December holidays, students were also taught how to create
their own flowerpot at our hands-on workshop. This was in line with the
theme of Flowers for that very week. This workshop would help to pique
the children's interest in flowers by showing them how to construct their
very own flower stalks. Students were taught how to use plasticine to create
the parts of a flower, rolling the materials into flower buds and using
various tools to mould each bud into a flower. Students then placed their
flower creations into a flower pot. The instructors encouraged them to
decorate the flowerpots with decorum of their own design. Children used
the materials to create various sorts of embellishments for their own flowerpots,
from commonplace additions such as leaves and rocks to more complex work
such as caterpillars circling the flowerpot and butterflies perched on
the flowers. The workshop was a great success, as it allowed children to
learn about flowers and to hone their arts and craft skills.</p>
