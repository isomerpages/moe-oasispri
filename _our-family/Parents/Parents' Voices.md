<p>We are glad that we have chosen Oasis Primary School for our kids. The
introduction of their school values &amp; 7 Habits is a great way of building
a strong foundation for our children. Keep up the good work in preparing
my kids and others for their future.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought that Oasis Pri Sch is just a neighbourhood school
but I start to realize it is more than that. I am a PV so I am able to
have opportunities to work with teachers and the school. I discovered their
passion, care, thoughtfulness, and hard work to help every child. All my
3 children are very happy with the school. They love all their teachers
and are always looking forward to go back to school after the holidays.
Thumbs up for Oasis Pri Sch!</p>

<p>Both my boys enjoy school and had wonderful teachers who have been caring
and loving throughout their school journey. My boys, who are in P6 and
P4 this year, are excited to learn more as their teachers use fun and motivational
teaching methods. I am always happy when they come home sharing what they
have learnt in school. Thank you Oasis Primary School for nurturing and
developing both my boys during their formative primary school years.</p>

<p>Our son Ephraim who is in P4 this year is coping well with his studies
and he is eager to learn more from his teachers.
<br>As parents, we give our full support to the teachers and have faith in
them because they are the second parents and at the same time, they are
like a friend to our children. We are so thankful for the school and the
support given by his teachers, for their patience is second to none. When
he was in P3, he felt so fortunate to be placed under Mr Desmond Lim's
class.
<br>I always remind him to do first thing first and work hand in hand with
the teachers in guiding him.
<br>Lastly, I would like to thank and show my deepest appreciation to the
Principal in the school. She is always present in every meeting I attended.
Mrs Ong also provided updates on how can parents can partner school so
that we can work together in the best interest of our child.</p>

<p>The dedication of the teachers in Oasis Primary School never fails to
amaze me. They always go the extra mile to help the students to ensure
that they never fall behind in their school works especially during CB
and HBL periods.
<br>This year my son will be taking his PSLE and I was pleasantly surprised
when his Science teacher, Ms Tan Li Na has even created a microsite to
consolidate all the learning materials, extra exercises, and videos for
the kids in her classes. This takes a lot of effort, time, and most importantly,
the dedication, care, and loving kindness of the teacher to support the
students. The other teachers have in one way or another taken the extra
efforts in teaching and coaching the students building up their resilience
and determination to overcome PSLE challenges.
<br>They have gone the extra miles to communicate with the parents on lessons
and class activities. We are very thankful and appreciate these "little
gestures" as it might seem but these little gestures have given us the
assurance that our son is in the good hands of all the teachers teaching
him. We appreciate the teachers of Oasis and their dedication!!</p>

<p>My children came home and tried to teach me what they had learnt in the
class. It is a joy to see them enjoying their time in school. All the teachers
are very friendly and responsive to parents' queries. During the HBL period,
it was tough for everyone. A special shoutout to Mrs Nathan as I can feel
her additional effort put in in lesson preparations and ensuring students
under her charge are able to catch up and coping well.</p>

<p>Aiden has been attending school at the Oasis Primary School for more than
2 years now. He has been very blessed to have wonderful teachers especially
his form teacher, Mrs Mey Asher See.</p>
<p>When he was on SHN, she compiled his work so that he would be able to
catch up on his studies.</p>
<p>Going beyond her teaching responsibilities, she almost bought Aiden his
favourite chicken rice which he was eyeing during his recess break! Aiden
always speaks fondly of all his teachers and had told me that there is
no other school he would like to go to than OPS!</p>

<p>The teachers are friendly and responsive, and we receive a lot information
either through the Parents Gateway or Student Handbook. The collaboration
between teachers and parents is strong and we are updated regularly, especially
those in the Parent Support Group (PSG). I am glad to volunteer in the
PSG and I look forward to be involved again when the opportunity arises!</p>

<p>Dear School Management Team and Teachers, we are very blessed that Si
En enrolled into a school that focuses on character building and at the
same time nurturing in her a keen-to-learn attitude.</p>
<p>The sunshine environment in Oasis Primary really helps to boost my child
to strive for her best in many ways. In her two years in school, we had
observed her growth and we are especially grateful to Miss Chew of 2019/2020
(P1 and 2 Harmony) for her love and patience for the children. She helped
to build a good foundation on them.</p>
<p>Looking forward to many more fruitful years at Oasis Primary School.</p>

<p>What clearly distinguishes OPS from many other schools I have interacted
with as an educator is its people. The staff morale is strong and that
makes the place feel like one big family.
<br>Every staff I have interacted with has left deep impression, from teachers
to admin staff and school attendants.
<br>This is the reason why my daughter has adjusted so well to life in school
even though she has never stepped foot into a school till Day 1 in Primary
1. For this, I am very grateful to all the staff from the OPS Family, especially
to all the teachers who have guided her over the last 2 years.</p>

<p>As a preschooler, Evan was a non-expressive introvert who commented very
little about how his school day used to be.
<br>However we see a difference in him almost immediately as soon as he started
Primary One. He would come home excited and shared what interesting activities
he had done in school. Evan is eager and looks forward to school every
morning.
<br>Apart from the well structured curriculum that lets him transit from Preschool
to Primary level easily, Evan's teachers also inculcate good moral values
in the children, such as being kind to each other in words and actions
and sharing with each other. I feel very blessed that Evan is growing in
Oasis. Oasis Primary is more than just a school, it is a part of our family.</p>

<p>My son started his primary education in Oasis Primary school in 2019.
He adjusted well to his classmates and he took a fond liking to his teachers.
The teachers have been extremely attentive to the needs of the children
under their tutelage. Now in his 3rd year in OPS, my son enjoys attending
school each day. I find that he is able to understand and enjoy subjects
like English and Mathematics by following the instructions of his teachers
in school and revising what he has learnt at home. The school premises
are clean.
<br>The form teacher and other subject teachers update my child's learning
progress to me frequently.
<br>Overall, I am delighted to have my son studying here and I remain confident
that this is the right place for his schooling at a young and impressionable
age.</p>

<p>We are glad to have chosen Oasis Primary School for our son.
<br>Thank you Mdm Poh Eng Hong, his form teacher and to the other subject
teachers who have been showing their sincere concerns, patience, giving
moral and academic support to my son, Izz Fayyaz.
<br>Each one of you has made a positive difference in my son's life. A true
great teacher is hard to find and it takes a big heart to help shape little
minds. Lots of love to the well-deserved teachers!</p>
