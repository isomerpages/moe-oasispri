PSG@Oasis follows a code of ethics and guidelines for all parent volunteers to abide by. The code of ethics and guidelines govern and guide all parent volunteers to be a:

**Supportive Partner in Actions and Education**

The PSG complements the school by aligning with the school’s objectives, supporting and strengthening the school’s programmes to improve our children’s well-being and learning. We partner and support the school by volunteering our 3 Ts – Time, Talent, Thoughts.

**Bridge Between Parents and School**

The PSG listens to parents’ feedback on school operations, practices and programmes, and provides feedback to the school. The PSG also facilitates the school’s communication to parents. However, we do not make decisions on behalf of the school.

**Magnet to Attract Other Parents**

Parents who are actively involved in the PSG can better reach out to other parents and involve them. Over time, more parents can contribute to make the school a conducive learning environment.
