Seize the opportunity to join us! Through our work, we will be closer to our children, understand them better, and help them in their educational journey.

As parents, we can:

*   enrich our children's learning in school
*   strengthen school-based activities
*   support the teachers to bring out the best in our children
*   guide other parents in their parenting journey

Our children would also benefit from our involvement. They tend to:

*   show a more positive attitude
*   have better school attendance and complete homework consistently
*   be able to bridge the gap between school and home
*   be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues
