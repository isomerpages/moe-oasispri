Seize the opportunity to join us! Through our work, we will be closer to our children, understand them better, and help them in their educational journey.

As parents, we can:
* enrich our children's learning in school
* strengthen school-based activities
* support the teachers to bring out the best in our children
* guide other parents in their parenting journey

Our children would also benefit from our involvement. They tend to:
* show a more positive attitude
* have better school attendance and complete homework consistently
* be able to bridge the gap between school and home
* be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues
