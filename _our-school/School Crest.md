<p>The school crest conjures up a conducive environment, in which our students
are engaged and challenged in their learning. The encompassing circles
represent a wholesome environment instrumental to the holistic development
of our students in the cognitive, moral, aesthetics, physical and social
domains.</p>
<p>The rising sun signifies vibrancy and passion in learning. The fluidity
of water symbolises adaptability and emphasises the importance of character
building. Anchoring on skills and values, our students will then thrive
in a volatile world.</p>
<p>The hardy palm tree embodies the disposition of resilience. Staying steadfast
in realising our school vision and mission; the school community is committed
in taking Oasis Primary School to greater heights with confidence.</p>
