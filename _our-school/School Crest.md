The school crest conjures up a conducive environment, in which our students are engaged and challenged in their learning. The encompassing circles represent a wholesome environment instrumental to the holistic development of our students in the cognitive, moral, aesthetics, physical and social domains.

  

The rising sun signifies vibrancy and passion in learning. The fluidity of water symbolises adaptability and emphasises the importance of character building. Anchoring on skills and values, our students will then thrive in a volatile world.

  

The hardy palm tree embodies the disposition of resilience. Staying steadfast in realising our school vision and mission; the school community is committed in taking Oasis Primary School to greater heights with confidence.
