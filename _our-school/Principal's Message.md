“If I have to choose one profession in which you give the most for the 
least, it is probably teaching – if you take it seriously. You have to 
have the temperament for it to coax, to stimulate, to cajole, to 
discipline a young mind into good habits. You must have an aptitude.”

Mr Lee Kuan Yew (1966)

The quote from our first Prime Minister encourages us, parents and teachers, to work together to nurture “a young mind into good habits”. We intend to do just that in Oasis Primary School. Our school provides a holistic education that supports our children to discover and nurture their strengths and interests. We want to develop our students into Passionate Learners and Caring Leaders by building a community of learners who can inspire self and others to lead with a heart. At the end of six years with us, our students will be able to communicate eloquently, be curious and creative, collaborate effectively and contribute to society.

To nurture holistic learners for the future and achieve the goals above, we have various key distinctive programmes for the young ones. These include our character development programme guided by school values; Oasis learning experiences of Discovery, Imagination and Changemaking; Learning for Life Programme (LLP) ‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for the Future’; ALP ‘Nurturing Language Artisans through an Inter-disciplinary Approach’; as well as Place-Based Learning (PBL) to create exploratory, meaningful and immersive learning for the students.

More importantly, undergirding all that we do, is to believe that every child matters. It is important to see them as whole persons and care for them. We want to provide a safe and conducive school environment for them to enjoy learning. One key approach is for them to feel connected to others and experience trusting relationships with their parents, teachers and friends.

In addition to our students, we – staff, parents and stakeholders – are all Oasians too. We are all learners, and we are all leaders. Let us ask ourselves what we can do for our school and one another. How can we work together in close partnership to educate our young ones? Our children are the young ones who will learn and lead, these are the champions and heroes of tomorrow who will grow up to care for others and contribute to our nation building, and these are the boys and girls of Oasis who we love. Therefore, it is up to us – adults – to join our hearts and hold hands to care for and mould their character. We choose to do these things for them, not because we have to, but because we want to. Let us all, as Oasians, have charity for all, cherish this bond we have with one another and strive unto success as a united school. Thank you.

Mr Danny Poh
