We started the school in 2016 with 210 students and 18 Education Officers. Since then, we have grown from strength to strength and despite being one of the younger schools in the Punggol area, we are encouraged by the public’s confidence in us, especially during the annual P1 Registration exercise.

  

As a school, we recognise that education goes beyond excelling academically. Therefore, my staff and I are committed to build a community of holistic learners who can inspire self and others to lead with a heart. Our vision of ‘Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders’ continue to guide us as we nurture and develop creative and curious Oasians who can communicate eloquently, collaborate effectively, contribute and celebrate actively.

  

In line with MOE’s directives on the Learn for Life movement, we will refresh our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum to make it more current, comprehensive and experiential for our Oasians. The refreshed CCE curriculum will anchor our Oasians on a strong foundation of moral values, good character and resilience, and prepare them to be changemakers of the future. We will encourage our Oasians to play a more active role as citizens of Singapore. In addition, we will also strengthen our Oasians’ digital literacy through the National Digital Literacy Programme. This will better enable them to be tech-savy and acquire the skills required to navigate the digital age at different stages of their primary school education journey.

  

To ensure that every Oasian can have access to a good education regardless of their family background, we will also go all out to uplift them. This will be done through providing those on MOE’s or the school’s subsidy schemes with school meals programmes, school fees and transport subsidies, after-school support and Edusave Merit Bursaries, where possible.

  

As shared by Minister Chan during the Committee of Supply Debate, the unprecedented Covid pandemic has accelerated many trends and also heightened the need for the education system to evolve. As we emerge stronger from this pandemic, we also want to ride on the waves of opportunities that have arisen. We want to help our students to better embrace technology, stay connected and give them the confidence to acquire knowledge for success. Even as they fail, we hope to develop in them the resilience to bounce back, pick up and try again. As a nation, we will then be able to achieve the vision of developing Confident Singaporeans, building a Competitive Singapore and forging a Cohesive Society.  
  

The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires. This famous quote by William Arthur Ward is indeed reflective of the endearing culture in our school. We are blessed with an excellent and instrumental team of teachers who share a common heartbeat and are devoted to giving their best. Most importantly, all of us share a strong conviction that our learners of today will become leaders of tomorrow. To support our teachers, we also have a plan for them to enhance their professional practice and teaching competencies through MOE’s ‘SkillsFuture for Educators’, a professional development roadmap. Some of our focus areas include CCE, E-Pedagogy and supporting students with Special Education Needs.

  

I take this opportunity to thank our stakeholders who have played and will continue to play significant roles in the education journey of our Oasians. We are heartened and honoured to work alongside our supportive parents and the team of parents in the school’s Parent Support Group. All your kind words of affirmation will continue to motivate us to give our best. With many hands on deck, we will continue to collaborate closely and help our Oasians discover the joy of learning, pursue and sustain their passions. As a collective, I am confident that we will continue to grow together, towards tomorrow.
