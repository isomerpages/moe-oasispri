Lyrics by Rachel Ee <br>
Composed by Laverne Ong <br>
Arranged by Lennie Chua

  

**Verse 1:**

Every day as a new day begins <br>
We arrive with open minds and hearts <br>
And hand in hand with our teachers and friends <br>
With passion we will do our part

  

**Verse 2:**

We will respect and care for one another <br>
We will learn to work in harmony <br>
We will rise united to every challenge <br>
And be the best that we can be

  

**Chorus:**

Our wonderful Oasis <br>
Where the bright sun is our guiding light <br>
Inspiring us to do our best <br>
Together we can shine so bright

  

Our beautiful Oasis <br>
Our haven where the palm trees sway <br>
It is here that we grow and learn <br>
And lead with our hearts each day

  

**Chorus:**

Our wonderful Oasis <br>
Where the bright sun is our guiding light <br>
Inspiring us to do our best <br>
Together we can shine so bright

  

Our beautiful Oasis <br>
Our haven where the palm trees sway <br>
It is here that we grow and learn } x2 <br>
And lead with our hearts each day } x2
