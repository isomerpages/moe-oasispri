<p>Oasis Wushu strives to encourage students to be confident and brave individuals.
It also inspires students to gain a better understanding and appreciation
towards Wushu and Chinese culture. Wushu is considered a “performing sport”,
consisting elements that are characteristic to both sports and performing
arts. Wushu is derived from Chinese martial arts and it teaches “Wu De”（武德）,
which is the martial code of conduct. Learners of Wushu are expected to
display excellence in their moral character and to uphold integrity and
moral courage at all times. Wushu improves one’s flexibility, speed, strength,
coordination and endurance. It also instils discipline and respect for
others and oneself.</p>
