**Strength comes from overcoming obstacles you once thought you could not.**

Oasis Wushu strives to encourage students to be confident and brave individuals. It also inspires students to gain a better understanding and appreciation towards Wushu and Chinese culture. Wushu is considered a “performing sport”, consisting elements that are characteristic to both sports and performing arts. Wushu is derived from Chinese martial arts and it teaches “Wu De”（武德）, which is the martial code of conduct.
