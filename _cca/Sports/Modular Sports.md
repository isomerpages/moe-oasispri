<p><strong>7 days without sports makes one weak (week)!</strong>
</p>
<p>Oasis Modular Sports Club was founded in 2020 to cater to the students
with diverse interests in a variety of sports. Students who attend Modular
Sports club will learn advanced skills of each sport and apply them to
the actual or modified games situation. Students will engage in team games
on a regularly basis. Equipped with skills to play these games, we hope
students will develop their passion for life-long participation in sports
and other physical activities.</p>
