**7 days without sports makes one weak (week)!**

Oasis Modular Sports Club was founded in 2020 to cater to the students with diverse interests in a variety of sports. Students who attend Modular Sports club will learn advanced skills of each sport and apply them to the actual or modified games situation. Students will engage in team games on a regularly basis. Equipped with skills to play these games, we hope students will develop their passion for life-long participation in sports and other physical activities.
