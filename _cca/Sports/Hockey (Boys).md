<p><strong>Teamwork makes the dream work!</strong>
</p>
<p>Oasis Hockey CCA provides students opportunities for character and leadership
development, while inculcating social and co-operative skills. Students
learn through working together as a team, taking on personal and collective
challenges, towards individual growth in virtues like teamwork, discipline
and responsibility. We hope to develop students with grit and resilience,
and who are respectful towards all.</p>
