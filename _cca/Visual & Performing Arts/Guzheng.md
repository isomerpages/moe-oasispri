**Tradition is beautiful!**

Oasis Guzheng Ensemble strives to inculcate a deep artistic appreciation for the 2000-year-old traditional Chinese instrument. This CCA brings out the best in teamwork, discipline and commitment, and it encourages every member to work together, forge friendships and learn skills that will last a lifetime. As we make beautiful music as a team, we hope to move hearts and inspire many others to desire playing the Guzheng.
