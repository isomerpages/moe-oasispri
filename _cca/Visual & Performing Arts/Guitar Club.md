<p><strong>Music is what feelings sound like</strong>

<p>The school has a new CCA, Guitar Club, which replaces Choir CCA. Guitar
Club members will learn the basic foundations of music and guitar performance.
Keeping in line with a Music Examination syllabus, students will be taught
how to read notes on the staff &amp; pluck classical tunes based on the
fundamentals of Note Reading and Rhythm understanding. Apart from the typical
styles of Classical playing, students will also be exposed to other styles
of Guitar performance in the style of Plucking Accompaniment, Strumming
&amp; Singing.</p>
