**Music is what feelings sound like**

The school has a new CCA, Guitar Club, which replaces Choir CCA. Guitar Club members will learn the basic foundations of music and guitar performance. Keeping in line with a Music Examination syllabus, students will be taught how to read notes on the staff & pluck classical tunes based on the fundamentals of Note Reading and Rhythm understanding. Apart from the typical styles of Classical playing, students will also be exposed to other styles of Guitar performance in the style of Plucking Accompaniment, Strumming & Singing.
