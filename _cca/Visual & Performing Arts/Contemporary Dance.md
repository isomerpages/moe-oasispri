<p><strong>The stage is your playground – dance like no one’s watching!</strong>
</p>
<p>Experts and researchers have claimed that dancing makes you smart! The
Oasis Contemporary Dance Club aims to develop students to be creative,
expressive and collaborative. Throughout the year, training grounded in
contemporary dance technique is infused with creative movement education,
dance appreciation through watching and critiquing dance performances,
and using the body as an expressive instrument to communicate ideas. Within
a year, dancers will learn to perform at least 2 dance repertoires, view
a live theatre performance at one of Singapore’s arts venues and be exposed
to other dance genres.</p>
