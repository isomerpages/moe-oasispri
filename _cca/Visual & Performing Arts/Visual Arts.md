**Creativity St**_ARTS_ **Here!**

  

Oasis Art Club allows students to create art by exploring different media such as clay, printmaking, batik painting, mixed media and stop motion. The various art projects the students undertook provided them opportunities to develop imagination, resourcefulness, resilience, problem-solving, team-working and technical skills. For art exposure, learning journeys are organised to raise students’ awareness of art around Singapore.
