**All The Worldâ€™s a stage!**

Oasis Drama Club aims to develop our students an appreciation and enjoyment of drama as an art form, as well as to build their self-discipline and confidence while fostering team building. Our CCA provides members with opportunities to explore various drama techniques as well as design, stage and craft their own productions based on experiences of school life or observations of current affairs as they happen! Students express their creativity through various drama skills such as Miming, Gibberish, Monologue, Script Writing, Tableaux and Improvisation. Students will also learn the art of lighting, staging management and prop production. Students will also be given opportunities to watch a theatre performance.
