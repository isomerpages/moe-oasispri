<p><strong>All The Worldâ€™s a stage!</strong>
</p>
<p>Oasis Drama Club aims to develop our students an appreciation and enjoyment
of drama as an art form, as well as to build their self-discipline and
confidence while fostering team building. Our CCA provides members with
opportunities to explore various drama techniques as well as design, stage
and craft their own productions based on experiences of school life or
observations of current affairs as they happen! Students express their
creativity through various drama skills such as Miming, Gibberish, Monologue,
Script Writing, Tableaux and Improvisation. Students will also learn the
art of lighting, staging management and prop production. Students will
also be given opportunities to watch a theatre performance.</p>
