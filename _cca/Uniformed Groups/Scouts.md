<p><strong>Be Prepared!</strong>
</p>
<p>Scouting in Oasis Primary School began in 2019. The Oasis Otters Scout
Unit is divided into smaller groups. In Scouting terms, each group is called
a ‘Six’ and the groups are named after animals such as&nbsp;<strong>Cobra, Coyote, Eagle, Gorilla, Rhino and Wolf</strong>.
Each ‘Six’ is led by a Sixer (Leader) and an Assistant Sixer (Assistant
Leader). Throughout the year, the scouts engage in team-building games
to get to know each other better and to build rapport. They also learn
survival skills and acquire knowledge through hands-on lessons and activities.
Badges are awarded to scouts to recognise their proficiency in the various
tasks. Our scouts also contribute to the community by undertaking fund-raising
activities. Eventually, we hope help build a better world where people
are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.</p>
