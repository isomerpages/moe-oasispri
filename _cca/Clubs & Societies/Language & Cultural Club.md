<p><strong>One World, Many Cultures.</strong>
</p>
<p>Oasis Language and Cultural Club (LCC) strives to encourage students to
read widely and share their knowledge from books with peers, and provide
students with incredible experiences to explore languages and cultures
beyond their own. Activities such as cultural exhibitions would enable
students to deepen their appreciation of local and regional cultures. Through
these, students learn new languages and foster strong friendships across
all races. New languages learnt complement our Oasis World Music packages
to expose students to a myriad of foreign languages. Learning journeys
to heritage sites will enable students to discover more of Singapore and
its development as a country.</p>
