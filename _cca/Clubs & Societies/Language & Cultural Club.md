**One World, Many Cultures.**

Oasis Language and Cultural Club (LCC) strives to encourage students to read widely and share their knowledge from books with peers, and provide students with incredible experiences to explore languages and cultures beyond their own. Activities such as cultural exhibitions would enable students to deepen their appreciation of local and regional cultures. Through these, students learn new languages and foster strong friendships across all races. New languages learnt complement our Oasis World Music packages to expose students to a myriad of foreign languages. Learning journeys to heritage sites will enable students to discover more of Singapore and its development as a country.
