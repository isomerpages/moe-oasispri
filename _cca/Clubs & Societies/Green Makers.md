<p><strong>Live green! We have no other planet to live on.</strong>
</p>
<p>Working towards “Sustainable Singapore” has been the primary focus for
Greenmakers Club. The club provides members with opportunities to be aware
of environmental issues through hands on and experiential learning. Students
are given opportunities to work as a team and be innovative in coming up
with environmental solutions in solving real life issues. Students are
also given platforms to share environmental projects and advocate greening
efforts during school and community events such as Earth Day, outreach
programmes carried out as recess activities or assembly programmes. We
hope to develop students’ civic responsibility towards the environment
for a greener future.</p>
