**Live green! We have no other planet to live on.**

Working towards “Sustainable Singapore” has been the primary focus for Greenmakers Club. The club provides members with opportunities to be aware of environmental issues through hands on and experiential learning. Students are given opportunities to work as a team and be innovative in coming up with environmental solutions in solving real life issues. Students are also given platforms to share environmental projects and advocate greening efforts during school and community events such as Earth Day, outreach programmes carried out as recess activities or assembly programmes. We hope to develop students’ civic responsibility towards the environment for a greener future.
