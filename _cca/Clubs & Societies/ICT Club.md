**Imagine, Create, Transform!**

  

ICT Club members are engaged in activities through the concept of ‘Learning Through Play’. They learn essential 21st Century skills of problem solving, creative and critical thinking. They will be tasked to think creatively (Imagine), develop designs or solutions (Create) in order to value add lives (Transform). Our club members will be involved in training programmes to inspire innovation through coding, in developing games and programming robots.
