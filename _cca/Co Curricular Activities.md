<h3>CCAs Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through
CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values
and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCAs
also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they
learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCAs foster social integration
and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility
to school, community and nation.</p>
<h3>CCA Policy</h3>
<p>CCA is an official school activity and all students from P3 to P6 are
strongly encouraged to participate in at least 1 CCA.</p>
<p>Students from P1 &amp; P2 may get chosen to join a CCA with parent/guardians’
consent.</p>
<p>Students need to produce a medical certificate or a letter from parents/guardians
stating reason(s) for absence from the scheduled CCA day/events.</p>
<p>Students are discouraged from changing their CCAs as they need time to
build knowledge and master their skills in the CCAs. It is important that
teamwork and leadership are honed in the same CCAs with their peers as
one grows and develops in his skills and leadership in the CCA concerned.
Therefore, requests for a change of CCAs may only be considered at the
end of P3 after spending 1 year in their CCAs. Change of CCAs is not encouraged
from P4 to P6, unless due to compelling reasons (e.g. medical).</p>
<p>To change CCAs, students need to fill in the CCA Transfer Form which can
be obtained through their current CCA teacher. All transfer cases must
be supported by a valid reason, e.g. by means of a parent/guardian’s letter
or a medical certificate. The transfer of CCA will be subjected to evaluation
by the current CCA IC and the new CCA IC, as well as availability of vacancy
in the new CCA. This will then be followed by the approval from the HOD
PE &amp; Aesthetics/SH PE &amp; CCA. An official notification will be given
to student either through the CCA teachers-in-charge or form teachers,
to inform parent/guardians/student of the status of the transfer request.
While the evaluation process of the transfer request takes place, the student
is expected to continue his/her current CCA activities.</p>
<p>A student may be suspended from CCA if he/she exhibits undesirable behaviour/attitude
despite repeated warnings and counselling. He/she will be required to sit
out at subsequent CCA sessions. Parent/guardians would be informed of the
suspension from CCA sessions.</p>
<p>Once per term, CCA training sessions will include Social Emotional Learning
lessons to provide opportunities to develop SEL competencies in our students.
The 5 domains that are integral to the SEL lessons are Self-Awareness,
Self-Management, Understanding of Others, Relationship Skills, Decision-making
skills.</p>
