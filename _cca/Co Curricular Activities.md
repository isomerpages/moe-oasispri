<h3>CCAs Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Through
CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values
and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCAs
also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they
learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCAs foster social integration
and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility
to school, community and nation.</p>
<h3>CCA Policy</h3>
<p>CCA is an official school activity and all students from P3 to P6 are
strongly encouraged to participate in at least 1 CCA.</p>
<p>Students from P1 &amp; P2 may get chosen to join a CCA with parent/guardians’
consent.</p>
<p>Students need to produce a medical certificate or a letter from parents/guardians
stating reason(s) for absence from the scheduled CCA day/events.</p>
<p>Students are discouraged from changing their CCA as they need time to
build knowledge and master their skills in the CCA. Requests for a change
of CCA will only be considered at the start of P4 after the students had
spent 1 Semester in their CCA.</p>
<p>To change CCA, the student will need to fill in the CCA Transfer Form
which can be obtained through their current CCA teacher. All transfer cases
must be supported by a valid reason, e.g. by means of a parent/guardian’s
email to SH PE &amp; CCA. The transfer of CCA will be subjected to evaluation
by the current CCA OIC and the new CCA OIC, as well as availability of
vacancy in the new CCA. After the approval by the SH PE &amp; CCA, an official
notification will be given to the student through the Form Teacher, to
inform parents/guardians the outcome of the transfer request. While the
evaluation process of the transfer request takes place, the student is
expected to continue his/her current CCA activities.</p>
<p>A student may be suspended from CCA if he/she exhibits undesirable behaviour/attitude
despite repeated warnings and counselling. He/she will be required to sit
out at subsequent CCA sessions. Parent/guardians would be informed of the
suspension from CCA sessions.</p>
<p>CCA training sessions will include Social Emotional Learning lessons to
provide opportunities to develop SEL competencies in our students once
per semester. The 5 domains that are integral to the SEL lessons are Self-Awareness,
Self-Management, Understanding of Others, Relationship Skills, Decision-making
skills.</p>
