We are pleased to inform you that our school is now onboard Parents Gateway. Parents Gateway is a one stop engagement portal specially designed for parents. Developed by MOE and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage with schools, receive information and perform a range of administrative functions such as giving consent for school trips.

We would like to invite all parents to download the Parents Gateway mobile app on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process. Please refer to&nbsp;[Annex A](/files/Parents-Gateway-Annex-A.pdf)&nbsp;or video for a step-by-step installation guide.

With effect from 2019 Term 3, parents who can access to Parents Gateway will receive information only via the mobile app. The school will continue to issue hardcopy letters to parents who are unable to come on board Parents Gateway.

We look forward to your support. Thank you very much!
