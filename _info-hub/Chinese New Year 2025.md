<p>Our Oasians kicked off the Chinese New Year with a range of fun and exciting
activities this year! During recess, they participated in engaging games
and had a blast. In class, they crafted beautiful decorations like snake
origami, corner bookmarks, and even performed a joyful snake dance. To
add to the festivities, we had a reunion snack break where everyone shared
delicious Chinese New Year treats together. This year, we also gathered
in the hall for a grand celebration, enjoying a fantastic concert to warmly
welcome the Year of the Snake. For the first time, students from MOE Kindergarten
joined in, performing in the concert and taking part in the recess games.
All students had a wonderful time, making this celebration truly memorable!</p>
