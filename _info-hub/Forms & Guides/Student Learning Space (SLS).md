<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Singapore Student Learning Space&nbsp;(SLS) is one of MOE’s key
initiatives to transform the learning experiences of Singaporean students
through the purposeful use of technology. All school leaders, teachers
and students in the national school system have access to the SLS.</p>

<p><strong>Transforming Teaching and Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>SLS is an online learning portal that allows all students to have equal
access to quality curriculum-aligned resources. These resources are available
to all students for major subjects from primary to pre-university level.
In line with the development of 21st Century Competencies (21CC), the SLS
encourages learners to be self-directed, and allows them to personalise
their learning according to their needs and interests.</p>
<p>The SLS also provides teachers with a range of tools to customise and
create meaningful learning experiences with technology. For example, teachers
have access to tools that help to make students’ thinking processes visible,
enabling teachers to make informed decisions and provide targeted intervention
to address any gaps in understanding. We believe such a learning experience
is essential to help your child to become an active and confident user
of technology.</p>
<p>The SLS also serves as a common online platform for teachers to apply,
adapt and share new pedagogies by facilitating collaborations among teachers
across classrooms and schools.</p>
<p>The SLS is continually being developed in response to needs of students
and teachers. Curriculum-aligned resources and system tools are continually
being improved and developed in line with suggestions and feedback from
teachers and students to cater to students’ diverse and evolving learning
needs.</p>
<p>The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) is accessible through the internet
browsers on either Windows PC, Mac, iPad or Android tablets (with screen
size larger than 7 inches for optimal user experience).</p>
