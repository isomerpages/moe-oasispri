<h4>Our Curriculum</h4><p>The MK curriculum is designed by preschool specialists to nurture children holistically to be confident, possess strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p><p>All MOE Kindergartens (MKs) offer the same curriculum and flagship programmes, and focus on:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Holistic development.</p></li><li><p>Integrated and active learning.</p></li><li><p>Learning through purposeful play and quality interactions.</p></li><li><p>Developing confidence and social skills.</p></li><li><p>Building a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p></li><li><p>Nurturing bilingualism in English and Mother Tongue Language (i.e. Chinese, Malay and Tamil languages).</p></li></ul><p>All MKs offer the three Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) – Chinese, Malay and Tamil – to encourage bilingualism in the early years and help lay a strong foundation for language learning in the later years MKs will work closely with their primary schools to smoothen and ease children's transition from Kindergarten to Primary 1 (P1).</p><h4>Our Curriculum Goals</h4><p>Our curriculum and programmes are based on the <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/preschool/curriculum" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework</a> that guides the development of kindergarten programmes in Singapore.</p><p>At MK, we believe preschool children are curious, active and competent learners. They’re keen to make sense of the world around them, and they learn best through active learning.</p><p>We strive to make learning authentic and relevant for your child through activities with a distinctive Singapore flavour.</p><p>Each MK class comprises up to 20 children, divided into smaller groups for specific activities.</p><p>In place of giving workbooks or worksheets as homework, we encourage family-based learning activities that you and your child can engage in together. This will help you bond with your child and share the joy of their growth and learning.</p><h4>Our Programmes</h4><p>Our curriculum comprises 2 flagship programmes, the HI-Light Programme and Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language (MTL). In addition, each term at MK will conclude in a Weeks of Wonder project.</p><h4><strong>HI-Light Programme</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 35%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Mkoasis/hilight.jpg"></div><p>The <strong>HI-Light programme </strong>is designed to support the holistic development of children by nurturing in them values, social and emotional skills and learning dispositions, as well as knowledge and skills across the following five learning areas through an integrated approach:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Aesthetics and creative expression</p></li><li><p>Discovery of the world</p></li><li><p>Health, safety and motor skills development</p></li><li><p>Language and literacy</p></li><li><p>Numeracy</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Starlight Programme</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Mkoasis/starlight.jpg"></div><p>Our Starlight Literacy Programme nurtures the children’s language skills through Big Books, songs, rhymes and games set in the local context.</p><p>Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early childhood, the focus is on developing children’s listening and speaking skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children’s interest in learning languages.</p><p>We use Big Books, songs, rhymes and games to help your child to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Develop listening, speaking and early literacy skills.</p></li><li><p>Enjoy English and their Mother Tongue Language (MTL) (i.e. Chinese, Malay or Tamil language).</p></li><li><p>Communicate with confidence.</p></li><li><p>Learn about local customs and traditions.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>MTL and bilingualism</strong></h4><p>Bilingualism is a cornerstone of Singapore’s education system. Learning our MTL gives us direct access to our cultural heritage, and can help us better understand our values, roots and identities.</p><p>At MK, we nurture bilingualism by focusing on listening, speaking and engaging children in games and activities that encourage early literacy development.</p><p>By using their MTL to communicate with teachers and their friends on a daily basis, children build a strong foundation that will prepare them for language learning in later years.</p><p>Our MK offers classes in the 3 official MTLs (Chinese, Malay and Tamil). We encourage children of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnic race to take their own MTLs.</p><h4><strong>Weeks of Wonder Projects</strong></h4><p>In these projects, children work together to investigate topics that interest them.</p><p>Each term at MOE Kindergarten (MK) culminates in a Weeks of Wonder (WoW) project. In a year, children complete 2 WoW projects in English and another 2 in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). Children will work together with their friends on a topic of their choice.</p><p>Through WoW projects, children learn to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Make their own decisions.</p></li><li><p>Solve problems and use process skills to make sense of the world around them.</p></li><li><p>Collaborate with one another.</p></li><li><p>Communicate confidently in English and their MTL.</p></li></ul><p>Through the process of finding answers to their own questions, WoW projects allow children to:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Experience the joy of self-motivated learning.</p></li><li><p>Build their confidence.</p></li><li><p>Strengthen their learning dispositions or positive behaviours and attitudes towards learning.</p></li></ul><p></p>
