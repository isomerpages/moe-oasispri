On the eve of Lunar New Year, our Oasians welcomed the Lunar New Year with a variety of exciting and engaging activities. They made beautiful decorative crafts in class, such as tiger origami, paper cutting, and paper puppets. After our reunion breakfast, Oasians also learned about the customs and traditions of the Lunar New Year through an exciting quiz within their level through Zoom. While we miss gathering together in the hall for a celebration, an entertaining programme was put together for a roaring welcome to the year of the Tiger.
