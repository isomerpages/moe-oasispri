##### NE Bulletin Discussion Lessons

In addition to the formal SS curriculum, Oasians engage in classroom discussions about contemporary issues through NE Bulletin Discussion Lessons. These lessons are conducted with the aim of getting students to be more informed citizens who are aware of what is happening around them. Oasians also participate in classroom discussions where they share their thoughts, ideas and beliefs about the contemporary issues raised.

##### Place-based Learning

Place-Based Learning is also part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary School.

Primary 2, 3 and 4 students will visit the mural walls on Storey 3 (Our Heritage Trail) to learn more about the different communities in Singapore, Singapore’s past and how our founding fathers have contributed to the independence of Singapore.

P6 Students will visit the mural walls on Storey 5 (Oasis Global Explorer) to learn more about the sustainable goals of the United Nations through a gamified experience. The experience supports the teaching and learning of SS lessons, focusing on the theme of ‘Sustainability’. It is aligned with the third cluster of study in SS, ‘Appreciating Singapore, the Region and the World We Live in”, where students learn about the diverse and global physical environment in the world they live in.

##### Learning Journeys

Each year, our students will also go on field-based learning journeys out of school as part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary School. Through these learning journeys, our students develop important skills and acquire knowledge from the environment that they have explored and learn to be more informed citizens who are aware of what is happening around them.

##### Commemorating Total Defence Day

Schools commemorate Total Defence Day (TDD) on 15 February annually to mark Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in 1942. TDD serves to remind our students that Singapore is defensible and we must defend Singapore ourselves. Total Defense has guided us through many difficult times, most recently, through our nation’s fight against COVID-19.

This year, the theme of the Total Defence campaign "Together We Keep Singapore Strong" focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.&nbsp; It highlights the importance in rallying Singaporeans together to overcome crisis. The focus this year is on food security and the six pillars of defense.

One of the highlights of commemorating TDD this year was the in-house skit put together by the teachers. The skitaimed to spread the messages of reducing food wastage and not to fall prey to scams. In addition, our students also participated in the various recess activities to understand how Singapore continues to have a constant supply of food for our people during difficult times.

##### International Friendship Day

International Friendship Day (IFD) celebrates the cultural diversities in ASEAN and the connection Singapore shares with her neighboring countries and beyond.

The theme for this year’s IFD is ‘Singapore in Asia’. Through this theme, we had the opportunity for students to be acquainted with the diverse and colorful culture and traditions of countries in Asia. It was a special event as our friends and teachers did a fashion parade to showcase the different traditional attires found in Asia.

Our Primary 6 students also participated in an inter-class costume design competition, where they were tasked to design an IFD costume that best represents Singapore in ASEAN or Asia.

Students also learnt that Singapore builds strong friendship bonds with her neighbors in Southeast Asia, therefore nurturing and inculcating among the students the spirit of friendship and collaboration with their peers.

##### Racial Harmony Day

The theme for Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2022 was “Our Multicultural Mosaic”. We commemorated the event with a series of activities that helped our students to better appreciate the diversity and uniqueness of our society. This included having our teachers and students donning the four major ethnic communities’ attires and playing traditional games that our parents and grandparents once played when they were young.

It was interesting to find out during the Assembly sharing that some places in Singapore are known to be streets of harmony. These places are known for having significant places of worship from different beliefs and religions on the same street.

Students were also introduced to people of different races and religions living together as neighbours in a HDB flat, the most common form of houses in Singapore. Together, Singaporeans learn to live in harmony with one another, and they even celebrated the different festivals from the ethnic communities in Singapore, as part of our multicultural mosaic heritage.

##### National Day Celebrations

As Singapore continued to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Oasians found a way to commemorate National Day (ND) differently in 2022. Our students rose to the occasion to put up a splendid performance for their fellow schoolmates under the guidance of our teachers. We had our first march-in contingent, consisting of Scouts and Prefects, to bring in the National and School flags during the Observance Ceremony. Other students from various CCAs like Wushu, Dance and Guzheng also showcased their talents through their performances.

To mark the special occasion, all students and staff of the Oasis family participated in a lock-down activity where they learnt to be prepared at all times. It was an enriching programme. We ended the celebration on a high note with the NDP 2022 theme song and evergreen favourites such as “Home” that all Singaporeans are familiar with. These songs resonated with our students because they reflect the changes of the nation and sentiment of the people. Stronger Together, Majulah!

##### Cyber Wellness

Aimed at raising an Oasian who is a positive influence, responsible and safe digital user, customized programmes such as differentiated assemblies were conducted to bring across age-appropriate messages to our students.

Oasians were also involved in the creation of our first Cyber Singa mascot. During one of the assembly programmes, the creator was given the opportunity to share his inspiration and hopes for his peers. This mascot was also used during recess activity and the peers were thrilled to be receiving bookmark reminders from the mascot.

##### Conducive Classroom Award

The school wishes to inculcate care and responsibility in Oasians where they take ownership of their classroom cleanliness and create a conducive learning environment. To this end, a team of teachers from the Character Development would visit the classes to affirm the cleanliness of each class by stamping stars on the Conducive Classroom Award chart displayed outside every classroom.

In addition, the “Use Your Hands Campaign” is also conducted at the end of each semester before the students go for their vacations. This is to instill in Oasians a sense of responsibility and pride in taking care of their learning environment.
