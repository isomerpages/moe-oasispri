<h4>Special Events in 2023</h4><p></p><h4>Transition to P1 Programme</h4><p><strong><em>The transition from preschool to primary school is one of the largest and most important changes children have to encounter &amp; manage at that age.</em></strong></p><p><em>Fabian &amp; Dunlop, 2006</em></p><p>A successful transition to Primary 1 has a positive impact on the children's academic performance, social and emotional development. Children who are adequately equipped with the skills to adapt to a new environment, will be able to ease into their primary school more quickly. The sooner they adapt, the better their school and learning experience will be.</p><p>In our MK, we start to nurture the children holistically from Day 1 of their kindergarten journey so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p><p>In addition, our team collaborates with parents and primary school educators in smoothening and easing the childrenâ€™s transition.</p><p>Towards the end of K2, the preparation becomes more deliberate. This includes doing activities such as visiting of primary school classrooms and participating in planned (structured) activities and routines.</p><p>Click on this <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/mk/first-flight-12.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> find out how the MOE Kindergarten (<strong>MK</strong>) curriculum supports children in their transition to Primary&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;(P1).</p><p></p><p></p>
