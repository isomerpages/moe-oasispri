“If I have to choose one profession in which you give the most for the 
least, it is probably teaching – if you take it seriously. You have to 
have the temperament for it to coax, to stimulate, to cajole, to 
discipline a young mind into good habits. You must have an aptitude.”

Mr Lee Kuan Yew (1966)<br>
