<h3><strong>Oasis Awards Day 2023</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Making Waves</strong>
<br>The Oasis Awards Day was held on 17 November 2023. It was a joyous occasion
filled with excitement and pride as we came together as one Oasis family
to acknowledge and affirm the achievements of our students and staff. We
extended a warm invitation to parents, encouraging them to join their children
on stage and partake in the celebration of their success.</p>
<p>Besides academics, our prize recipients excel or contribute meaningfully
in various fields – be it the arts, sports, and community work. We recognise
that each student is unique, with their own interests, strengths, passions,
and as a one Oasis community, we should continue to encourage and celebrate
this diversity. Let us applaud their excellence and hard work, and may
our Oasians continue to flourish and make splashing waves in years to come!</p>

<p>In this lesson, students will learn to distinguish between the characteristics
of love and infatuation and identify the strong emotions that may arise
from experiencing the feelings of infatuation. They will recognise that
experiencing feelings of infatuation is part of growing up and becoming
infatuated with someone does not mean that they should be involved in a
romantic relationship. Instead, they should focus on building strong and
healthy friendships with their circles of friends.

<p>This lesson focuses on helping students to know what pornography is and
how it can affect themselves and others. Students will learn the dangers
of being exposed to sexually explicit materials and reject the viewing
and/or reading of pornographic materials. They will learn to evaluate their
own responses when they encounter pornography by applying the strategy
‘**Stop-Think-Do**'.
<br>
<br>This lesson is conducted separately for boys and girls in different classrooms,
so that the students will feel more comfortable during the discussions.</p>
