<center><b>SHINE Oasians: Serve with a Heart and Inspire Everyone through words and actions</b></center>

### Department Goals

**Nurture our students to be good individuals and contributing citizens of Singapore through the teaching of values and the 7 habits of The Leader in Me (TLiM) programme, as well as developing of Socio-Emotional competencies.**

### Our Approach

##### **Character Development**

The CCE department customises and delivers the different components of CCE (comprising CCE lessons, Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons, school-based CCE and CCE Guidance Modules) to provide the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to be taught to our students. Oasians are also encouraged to put values into practice within the context of real-life situations in the family, school, community, nation and the world through their Values-In-Action projects.

##### **Citizenship Education**

Citizenship education nurtures our Oasians to develop dispositions towards national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instill in them the confidence in Singapore’s future. In addition to Social Studies lessons, citizenship education is also conducted through commemorative events such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, termly discussions through our NE bulletin news as well as learning journeys.

##### **Student Leadership**

As the school’s Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP), our student leadership programme aims to nurture our Oasians to be leaders who serve and lead with empathy, and contribute positively to the community through the following tiers:

		1.  Self-Leadership
		2.  Team Leadership
		3.  Change Leadership

##### P1 VIA - Be Gracious@Recess

‘Be Gracious@Recess’, our VIA programme for Primary 1 aims to imbue good habits and table etiquette in our Oasians. They will be taught to practice personal hygiene by first washing their hands before taking their meals in the canteen. They are also encouraged to reduce food wastage, return their cutlery and conduct wipe down of the table after eating.

Two Gracious Ambassadors are appointed from each P1 class to remind their classmates to be Gracious@Recess. Students are encouraged to be responsible in keeping their tables and floor clean. The classes will be assessed on the cleanliness of the tables and the floor assigned and certificates are issued to classes to reaffirm the students’ effort.

##### P2 VIA - Happy Toilet

‘Happy Toilet’, our VIA programme for Primary 2 aims to nurture socially responsible students who practise good toilet habits with Integrity . Students are ‘caught doing right’, organised with the intention of encouraging and affirming them. A checklist is also displayed in the toilet to remind students to practise good toilet habits such as flushing the toilets after use and washing their hands with soap in the basin.

In collaboration with the Student Development Team, all P2 students will pen notes of gratitude to the cleaners for their hard work in washing and keeping the toilets clean every day. They will also write thank you notes, which are framed and presented to the school cleaners.

##### P5 VIA - Green Oasians

“Green Oasians” is the VIA programme for P5 students and this is done in partnership with the English Department and as part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP). Through this programme, P5 Oasians embark on a journey to care for the environment and they will also visit the Sustainable Singapore Wall in the school (as part of Place-Based Learning) to understand about the environmental efforts undertaken by Singapore to promote environmental sustainability.

To further strengthen the advocacy on caring for the environment and harmony in nature, the P5 students will also design and create posters advocating ‘green’ messages. Physical posters and e-posters are also showcased and students will also conduct presentation to their peers.
