### Chinese New Year

Our Oasians welcomed the Chinese New Year with a variety of interesting and exciting activities this year! They played engaging games during recess and had much fun! They also made beautiful decorative crafts in class, such as rabbit origami, paper cutting, paper puppets and auspicious four-word collage. On top of that, we had our reunion snack break where Oasians shared a wonderful time having Chinese New Year related snacks together. We get to gather in the hall for a celebration this year, all Oasians enjoyed a fantastic concert for a huge welcome to the year of the Rabbit.
