The annual Oasis Awards Day was held on Fri 18 Nov 2022. This year’s theme, “Together We Celebrate” commemorated the success and achievements of our students through various awards presentations. Our CCA groups, Guzheng, Contemporary Dance and Wushu, put up captivating performances which enthralled the audience. The event ended with a special segment to thank and bid farewell to Oasis Primary School’s very first Principal, Mrs Ong-Chew Lu See. We thanked Mrs Ong for her leadership and guidance for the past seven years!
