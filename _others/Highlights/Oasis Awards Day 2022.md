<h4><strong>Oasis Awards Day 2022</strong></h4>
<p>The annual Oasis Awards Day was held on Fri 18 Nov 2022. This year’s theme,
“Together We Celebrate” commemorated the success and achievements of our
students through various awards presentations.&nbsp;Our CCA groups, Guzheng,
Contemporary Dance and Wushu, put up captivating performances which enthralled
the audience. The event ended with a special segment to thank and bid farewell
to Oasis Primary School’s very first Principal, Mrs Ong-Chew Lu See. We
thanked Mrs Ong for her leadership and guidance for the past seven years!</p>
