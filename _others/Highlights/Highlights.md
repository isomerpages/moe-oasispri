### Oasis Awards Day 2023

**Making Waves**<br>
The Oasis Awards Day was held on 17 November 2023. It was a joyous occasion filled with excitement and pride as we came together as one Oasis family to acknowledge and affirm the achievements of our students and staff. We extended a warm invitation to parents, encouraging them to join their children on stage and partake in the celebration of their success.

Besides academics, our prize recipients excel or contribute meaningfully in various fields – be it the arts, sports, and community work. We recognise that each student is unique, with their own interests, strengths, passions, and as a one Oasis community, we should continue to encourage and celebrate this diversity. Let us applaud their excellence and hard work, and may our Oasians continue to flourish and make splashing waves in years to come!
