They’re keen to make sense of the world around them, and they learn best through active learning.</p><p>We strive to make learning authentic and relevant for your child through activities with a distinctive Singapore flavour.</p><p>Each MK class comprises up to 20 children, divided into smaller groups for specific activities.</p><p>In place of giving workbooks or worksheets as homework, we encourage family-based learning activities that you and your child can engage in together. This will help you bond with your child and share the joy of their growth and learning.</p><h4>Our Programmes</h4><p>Our curriculum comprises 2 flagship programmes, the HI-Light Programme and Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language (MTL). In addition, each term at MK will conclude in a Weeks of Wonder project.</p><p></p>
