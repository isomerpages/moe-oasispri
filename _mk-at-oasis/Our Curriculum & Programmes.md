They’re keen to make sense of the world around them, and they learn best through active learning.</p><p>We strive to make learning authentic and relevant for your child through activities with a distinctive Singapore flavour.</p><p>Each MK class comprises up to 20 children, divided into smaller groups for specific activities.</p><p>In place of giving workbooks or worksheets as homework, we encourage family-based learning activities that you and your child can engage in together. This will help you bond with your child and share the joy of their growth and learning.</p><h4>Our Programmes</h4><p>Our curriculum comprises 2 flagship programmes, the HI-Light Programme and Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language (MTL). In addition, each term at MK will conclude in a Weeks of Wonder project.</p><h4><strong>HI-Light Programme</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 35%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Mkoasis/hilight.jpg"></div><p>The <strong>HI-Light programme </strong>is designed to support the holistic development of children by nurturing in them values, social and emotional skills and learning dispositions, as well as knowledge and skills across the following five learning areas through an integrated approach:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Aesthetics and creative expression</p></li><li><p>Discovery of the world</p></li><li><p>Health, safety and motor skills development</p></li><li><p>Language and literacy</p></li><li><p>Numeracy</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Starlight Programme</strong></h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Mkoasis/starlight.jpg"></div><p>Our Starlight Literacy Programme nurtures the children’s language skills through Big Books, songs, rhymes and games set in the local context.</p><p>Language learning is a dynamic and ongoing process that begins in infancy and early childhood and continues throughout the schooling years. In early childhood, the focus is on developing children’s listening and speaking skills. An active, interactive approach helps to nurture children’s interest in learning languages.</p><p>We use Big Books, songs, rhymes and games to help your child to:</p><p></p>
