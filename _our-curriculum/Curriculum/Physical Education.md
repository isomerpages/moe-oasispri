### Department Goals
Enrich students with physical skills, health practices and values to enjoy and appreciate the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life

### Our Approach

**Holistic Health Promotion Approach**

To provide opportunities for every student to develop the skills and attitudes to live healthily, and build students' motivation to sustain a healthy lifestyle even after they leave school.

**Guided by Total well-being**: Total well-being goes beyond weight and fitness to encompass the physical, mental and social health of students.

**Talent Development**

**Stage 1: Developing Awareness for an active lifestyle**

Students indulge in recreational participation through development of physical- and/or sport-specific skills and tactic, sustained involvement in physical activities and/or sports based on interest and competence, application of principles of training and safe practices and maintenance of health and skill-related fitness.

**Stage 2: Developing Foundation for broad-based development and sports pursuit**

*   Students acquire overall skills and concepts (across and within physical activities and sports), apply knowledge in application in developmentally-appropriate physical activities and sports, engage in a range of physical and sporting experiences that is fun and inclusive, that allows them to understand the principles of training and safe practices and be able to develop health and skills-related fitness.
*   Students acquire fundamental motor skills and movement concepts, learn and enjoy through developmentally-appropriate movement experiences.
*   Students consolidate sport-specific skills and tactics, apply training in competitions, develop mental strength, sport-specific skills and fitness conditioning.

**Technology-Enabled**

In nurturing a school of future-ready digital learners, technology-enabled education is a key approach that promotes deep learning. During Physical Education (PE) lessons, ICT-enabled tasks are planned and integrated effectively in curriculum to enable critical thinking and collaboration.

### Key Programmes

**Project Zero**

In 2020, Project Zero is conceived to be an important aspect of the PE curriculum to enhance safety at play and to equip students with basic first aid skills. An online module on basic first aid was designed and rolled out to all students in April 2020. With greater awareness in safe play and knowledge of basic first aid, we hope to students will continue to keep themselves and their friends safe.

**Oasis Blaze**

Oasis Blaze is a culmination of forging strong friendships and building character over sports, games and the arts. The Houses of Oasis – Emerald, Ruby, Sapphire and Topaz are represented by students from Primary 3 to Primary 5 yearly in a friendly battle of game skills and cheers in which students are judged by their performance as a House rather than as individuals.

**Outdoor Education**

Outdoor Education engages the students’ sense of adventure through the exploration of both natural and urban environments from their immediate surroundings to other unfamiliar locations. Oasis is blessed to be able to leverage Coney Island and the Punggol Waterway as environments for our students to develop outdoor skills through physical activities while cultivating an attitude of care and appreciation for the environment, and thoughtful consideration of the risks and safety of self and others. In these outdoor learning settings, students learn to be safe and make good judgements and develop connections with the environment and the responsibility to safeguard it, thereby facilitating a lifelong pursuit of outdoor physical recreation.
