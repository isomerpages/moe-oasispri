### Department Goals
Enrich students with physical skills, health practices and values to enjoy and appreciate the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life

### Our Approach

**Holistic Health Promotion Approach**

To provide opportunities for every student to develop the skills and attitudes to live healthily, and build students' motivation to sustain a healthy lifestyle even after they leave school.

**Guided by Total well-being**: Total well-being goes beyond weight and fitness to encompass the physical, mental and social health of students.

**Talent Development**

  

**Stage 1: Developing Awareness for an active lifestyle**

Students indulge in recreational participation through development of physical- and/or sport-specific skills and tactic, sustained involvement in physical activities and/or sports based on interest and competence, application of principles of training and safe practices and maintenance of health and skill-related fitness.
