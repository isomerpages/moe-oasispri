<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>The Art Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with MOE’s standards, the Art Education @Oasis aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop students to be visually literate to observe, understand and make
meaning of what they see; and to communicate their ideas by using and creating
visuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop an appreciation for art by seeing the value and recognising the
relevance of art in their lives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Art lessons @Oasis studies a huge range of artists’ works and its cultural
contexts in different time period and location, gives students the tools
to access art not just intuitively but also technically. The 3 artistic
processes – Connecting, Creating and Communicating – undergird the classroom
pedagogy and is in line with the skills and values standards in the MOE
Art syllabus. Students are&nbsp;<em>connecting</em>&nbsp;by analyzing meaning
and relating artistic ideas to its context,&nbsp;<em>creating</em>&nbsp;by
imagining and developing new artistic ideas, and&nbsp;<em>communicating</em>&nbsp;by
presenting their artistic ideas and works through in-progress classroom
gallery displays or exhibitions.</p>
<p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been infused in the
teaching pedagogy not only for students to develop self-directedness in
their learning, but also skillful users of technology tools in Art-learning.</p>

musical ideas to its context,&nbsp;<em>creating</em>&nbsp;by imagining
