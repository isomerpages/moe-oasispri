<p>Empathetic Communicators, Discerning Readers and Creative Inquirers who
are informed, concerned and participative citizens of Singapore and the
world.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Department Goals</strong></h4>
<p>Here at Oasis, our goals are to develop Oasians to be <strong>(i) Empathetic Communicators; (ii) Discerning Readers; and (iii) Creative Inquirers.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp;Empathetic communicators</strong> possess the values,
dispositions, and skills to listen actively to different perspectives,
communicate confidently, effectively, and sensitively, and collaborate
with others to work towards shared goals.</p>
<p>Therefore, Oasians <strong>ACE</strong> as <strong>Empathetic Communicators</strong>,
as they are able to:</p>
<p><strong>A: <u>A</u>ctively</strong> listen to different perspectives</p>
<p><strong>C: <u>C</u>ommunicate</strong> confidently and sensitively while
collaborating</p>
<p><strong>E: <u>E</u>mbody </strong>cultural awareness and foster inclusivity</p>
<p><strong>(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;Discerning readers </strong>possess broad worldviews
by staying well-informed and self-directed in their use of information.
They are able to distinguish fact from falsehood by processing and evaluating
information critically.</p>
<p>Oasians are <strong>WISE</strong>  <strong>Discerning Readers</strong>, as
they are:</p>
<p><strong>W: <u>W</u>ell-informed</strong> and self-directed</p>
<p><strong>I: <u>I</u>nformation</strong> processors and evaluators</p>
<p><strong>S: <u>S</u>killed</strong> at discerning according to purpose,

<p><strong>E: <u>E</u>xperts</strong> at distinguishing fact from falsehood</p>
<p><strong>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp; Creative inquirers</strong> explore and evaluate
real-world issues and multiple perspectives, as well as gather and synthesise
information from diverse print, non-print, and digital sources.</p>
<p>Therefore, Oasians are inquirers as they:</p>
<p><strong>I: <u>I</u>nvestigate</strong> real-world issues and multiple perspectives</p>
<p><strong>N: <u>N</u>avigate</strong> diverse print, non-print, and digital

<p><strong>E: <u>E</u>xplore</strong> solutions through collaboration</p>
<p><strong>R: <u>R</u>esolve</strong> challenges in familiar or new contexts</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach:</strong></h4>
<p>Oasians will establish a strong foundation in the English language through
experiences of <strong>Discovery</strong>, <strong>Imagination</strong>,
and <strong>Change-making</strong>. These experiences will enable students
to apply their knowledge, skills, and demonstrate their learning by using
the language effectively.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Discovery:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students’ spirit of inquisitiveness and curiosity will be piqued through
the discovery of content from the various reading materials and genres.</p>
<p>Students’ competencies in communication, contribution, creativity, and
creation&nbsp;&nbsp; will be developed through the reinforcement and extension
of language skills such as (i) reading and viewing and (ii) speaking and
representing.</p>
<p><strong>Imagination:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students’ interest in the English language will be ignited through various
literacy and literary programs. These programs provide students with opportunities
to express their ideas creatively and be inventive in their thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Change-making:</strong>
</p>
<p>Students’ sense of agency and advocacy will be invoked through specially
curated activities, such as writing notes for their pen pals from other
schools and communicating effectively with their friends from other countries.</p>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>To achieve our goals, we have specially curated the following language
learning experiences for our students:</p>
<p><strong><u>Oasis Learning Experience (OLE Week) and Literature is Alive</u></strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p><em>Teamwork in action: Students working in harmony during OLE week.</em>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English Language/learningole.jpg">
</div>
<p>For our Primary 3 and 4 students, literature lessons are designed to awaken
their emotions and pique their sense of wonder. During OLE Week, the interdisciplinary
approach taken is more focused on the learning experience than outcomes,
and is tailored to be age-appropriate.</p>

<p><em>Students developing and expanding their literary knowledge and skills through hands-on activities.</em>
</p>
<p>These literature lessons are crafted to instill a sense of ownership in
students' learning. Students' literary growth is promoted through reading,
reflecting, and re-evaluating their responses as they share perspectives
in group discussions. Through spoken and written forms, they are given
opportunities to articulate their thoughts, reflections, and experiences
of a literary work, and explain how an author makes a story effective.
They then apply their learning through assigned tasks, presentations, or
Values-In-Action projects.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Primary 3 students explore the literature text "Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory," where they learn how to overcome challenges they may face. They
gain hands-on experience working in groups to design prototypes such as
chocolate bars and chocolate bar wrappers. They then participate in activities
that allow them to reflect on and share their experiences of overcoming
personal challenges.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/English Language/p4wonder.jpg">
</div>
<p>Primary 4 students explore the literature text "Wonder," where they learn
to appreciate those who may not think, look, or act the same way as they
do. They also learn about being empathetic, accepting differences, and
celebrating diversity. Students learn to put themselves in others’ shoes
and extend respect and appreciation.</p>

<p>During OLE Week, our Primary 5 students explore Media Literacy as part
of the school-based curriculum. This develops our students as discerners
of information in media and as skillful creators of information and media
messages. It also fosters creative thinking in our students.</p>
