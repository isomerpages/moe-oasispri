<center><b>Eloquent and effective communicators in a media-rich environment</b></center>

### Department Goals

To develop Oasians to be:

*   **Empathetic communicators**&nbsp;who possess the values, dispositions and skills to listen actively to different perspectives, communicate confidently, effectively and sensitively while collaborating with others to work towards shared goals.
*   **Discerning readers**&nbsp;who possess broad worldviews by staying well informed and self-directed in the use of information, and are able to distinguish fact from falsehood by processing and evaluating information critically.
*   **Creative inquirers**&nbsp;who explore and evaluate real-world issues and multiple perspectives as well as gather and synthesize information from diverse print, non-print and digital sources.
		 
### Our Approach

Here at Oasis, we want to focus on the enjoyment of language as students formally learn the metalanguage and grammatical items associated with texts. There will be systematic and explicit instruction of grammar, with a focus on word, phrase and sentence level grammar before a gradual incorporation of text level grammar.


We also emphasised on learning-focused interaction at class and group levels. Teachers provide opportunities for students to learn and use language appropriately and meaningfully in a wide variety of contexts according to purpose, audience, context and culture.

Teachers will help students achieve effective use of English through exposing students to information-rich content and texts with increasing sophistication and complexity from multiple print, non-print and digital networked sources thus developing critical literacy skills in our students.

### Key Programmes
**Be Engaged About Reading (B.E.A.R) Programme**

Students will embark on the B.E.A.R Programme for an entire week each year.

Reading is also promoted through other platforms here at Oasis. New library books are introduced to all students during talks and sharing conducted by teachers and students. Books are recommended to students on a regular basis to inculcate the love for reading.

**Literature Is Alive @ Oasis**

Literature holds a prominent role in children's personal development since the reader becomes emotionally attached with the story and this has positive effects not only on the personal growth but also on the whole learning process.

Through our Literature programme, students are taught to appreciate and analyse good language use and to be sensitive and empathetic towards others through the stories of the lives of the characters.

**A Reader-Centred Approach**

Students to be free to deal with their own reactions to the text. The aesthetic response to a literary work is primary and inviolable. There are no right, wrong or definitive interpretations of a text. Each reader brings meaning from the text through his or her unique transaction, because each brings to the process particular experience of life and other texts. (Rosenblatt, 1938)

**Book Character Day**

On Book Character Day, students and staff dress up as their favourite characters from books they love. We bring the book that our character is in and we have a parade around the school! From the Rainbow Fish to the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland, students get to share with each other the characters they are dressed up as and are introduced to many more books on this day! It’s a blast! So much fun and creativity to promote the love of reading!
