<p><strong>Eloquent and effective communicators in a media-rich environment</strong>
</p>
<h3>Department Goals</h3>
<p>To develop Oasians to be:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Empathetic communicators</strong>&nbsp;who possess the values,
dispositions and skills to listen actively to different perspectives, communicate
confidently, effectively and sensitively while collaborating with others
to work towards shared goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discerning readers</strong>&nbsp;who possess broad worldviews
by staying well informed and self-directed in the use of information, and
are able to distinguish fact from falsehood by processing and evaluating
information critically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creative inquirers</strong>&nbsp;who explore and evaluate real-world
issues and multiple perspectives as well as gather and synthesize information
from diverse print, non-print and digital sources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>Here at Oasis, we want to focus on the enjoyment of language as students
formally learn the metalanguage and grammatical items associated with texts.
There will be systematic and explicit instruction of grammar, with a focus
on word, phrase and sentence level grammar before a gradual incorporation
of text level grammar.</p>
<p>We also emphasised on learning-focused interaction at class and group
levels. Teachers provide opportunities for students to learn and use language
appropriately and meaningfully in a wide variety of contexts according
to purpose, audience, context and culture.</p>
<p>Teachers will help students achieve effective use of English through exposing
students to information-rich content and texts with increasing sophistication
and complexity from multiple print, non-print and digital networked sources
thus developing critical literacy skills in our students.</p>

<p><strong>Literature Is Alive @ Oasis</strong>
</p>
<p>Literature holds a prominent role in children's personal development since
the reader becomes emotionally attached with the story and this has positive
effects not only on the personal growth but also on the whole learning
process.</p>
<p>Through our Literature programme, students are taught to appreciate and
analyse good language use and to be sensitive and empathetic towards others
through the stories of the lives of the characters.</p>
<p><strong>A Reader-Centred Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>Students to be free to deal with their own reactions to the text. The
aesthetic response to a literary work is primary and inviolable. There
are no right, wrong or definitive interpretations of a text. Each reader
brings meaning from the text through his or her unique transaction, because
each brings to the process particular experience of life and other texts.
(Rosenblatt, 1938)</p>

<p><strong>Book Character Day</strong>
</p>
<p>On Book Character Day, students and staff dress up as their favourite
characters from books they love. We bring the book that our character is
in and we have a parade around the school! From the Rainbow Fish to the
Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland, students get to share with each other
the characters they are dressed up as and are introduced to many more books
on this day! It’s a blast! So much fun and creativity to promote the love
of reading!</p>
