<center><b>Eloquent and effective communicators in a media-rich environment</b></center>

### 1. Department Vision

* Communicators, Discerning Readers, and Creative Inquirers

Our vision for the English Department at Oasis Academy is to cultivate a community of Oasians who possess the values, dispositions, and skills to excel in communication, critical thinking, and creativity. Through our comprehensive English curriculum, we strive to develop students who are:

1. **Empathetic Communicators:** Equipped with active listening skills, our students engage with diverse perspectives, communicate confidently, effectively, and sensitively, and collaborate with others to achieve shared goals. They understand the importance of empathy in fostering meaningful connections and promoting understanding.

2. **Discerning Readers:** Our students become discerning readers with broad worldviews. They are well-informed and self-directed in their use of information, allowing them to distinguish fact from falsehood. Through critical thinking and evaluation, they develop the ability to process information critically, making informed judgments and fostering a deeper understanding of the world.

3. **Creative Inquirers:** Our students are encouraged to explore and evaluate real-world issues from multiple perspectives. They have the skills to gather and synthesize information from diverse sources, including print, non-print, and digital media. By nurturing their curiosity and creativity, we empower them to think independently, propose innovative solutions, and engage with complex topics.
	 
### 2. Our Approach

Here at Oasis, we want to focus on the enjoyment of language as students formally learn the metalanguage and grammatical items associated with texts. There will be systematic and explicit instruction of grammar, with a focus on word, phrase and sentence level grammar before a gradual incorporation of text level grammar.

We also emphasised on learning-focused interaction at class and group levels. Teachers provide opportunities for students to learn and use language appropriately and meaningfully in a wide variety of contexts according to purpose, audience, context and culture.

Teachers will help students achieve effective use of English through exposing students to information-rich content and texts with increasing sophistication and complexity from multiple print, non-print and digital networked sources thus developing critical literacy skills in our students.

### 3. Programme

##### 3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Lower Primary Speech and Drama Programme

The Speech and Drama Programme for our lower primary students aims to develop their confidence and the ability to use the English Language fluently in different contexts. Through this fun and engaging programme, students will get the opportunity to learn important life skills such as public speaking and hone their accuracy in speech and pronunciation. They will also enhance their skills in vocal projection, facial expression and stage presence. At the end of the programme, students will get to perform on stage to showcase what they have learned.

##### 3.2 Middle Primary Literature Programme

The literature programme for our middle primary students aims to foster a love for reading, enhance writing skills, and introduce students to basic literary analysis. Two texts, “Wonder” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” are introduced in primary three and four respectively.&nbsp;

Students will have the opportunity to analyse the characters’ development, plot structure, and symbolism present in these texts. They can learn to identify literary devices used by the author, such as metaphors or similes, and discuss how they contribute to the overall meaning of the story. These activities foster critical thinking and help students appreciate the craft of storytelling. Through group discussions, literature circles and debates, they develop empathy and learn to participate with respect, conviction and sensitivity.&nbsp;

Students also get to unleash their creativity through writing activities. For example, our primary four students write their own version of the story with new characters, describe magical inventions, and imagine different adventures within the chocolate factory. This activity not only enhances their writing skills but also allows them to explore their own ideas and expand their storytelling abilities.

**Literature Is Alive @ Oasis**

Literature holds a prominent role in children's personal development since the reader becomes emotionally attached with the story and this has positive effects not only on the personal growth but also on the whole learning process.

Through our Literature programme, students are taught to appreciate and analyse good language use and to be sensitive and empathetic towards others through the stories of the lives of the characters.

**A Reader-Centred Approach**

Students to be free to deal with their own reactions to the text. The aesthetic response to a literary work is primary and inviolable. There are no right, wrong or definitive interpretations of a text. Each reader brings meaning from the text through his or her unique transaction, because each brings to the process particular experience of life and other texts. (Rosenblatt, 1938)

**Book Character Day**

On Book Character Day, students and staff dress up as their favourite characters from books they love. We bring the book that our character is in and we have a parade around the school! From the Rainbow Fish to the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland, students get to share with each other the characters they are dressed up as and are introduced to many more books on this day! It’s a blast! So much fun and creativity to promote the love of reading!
