<p>Empathetic Communicators, Discerning Readers and Creative Inquirers who
are informed, concerned and participative citizens of Singapore and the
world.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Department Goals</strong></h4>
<p>Here at Oasis, our goals are to develop Oasians to be <strong>(i) Empathetic Communicators; (ii) Discerning Readers; and (iii) Creative Inquirers.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp;Empathetic communicators</strong> possess the values,
dispositions, and skills to listen actively to different perspectives,
communicate confidently, effectively, and sensitively, and collaborate
with others to work towards shared goals.</p>
<p>Therefore, Oasians <strong>ACE</strong> as <strong>Empathetic Communicators</strong>,
as they are able to:</p>
<p><strong>A: <u>A</u>ctively</strong> listen to different perspectives</p>
<p><strong>C: <u>C</u>ommunicate</strong> confidently and sensitively while
collaborating</p>
<p><strong>E: <u>E</u>mbody </strong>cultural awareness and foster inclusivity</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp;Discerning readers </strong>possess broad worldviews
by staying well-informed and self-directed in their use of information.
They are able to distinguish fact from falsehood by processing and evaluating
information critically.</p>
<p>Oasians are <strong>WISE</strong>  <strong>Discerning Readers</strong>, as
they are:</p>
<p><strong>W: <u>W</u>ell-informed</strong> and self-directed</p>
<p><strong>I: <u>I</u>nformation</strong> processors and evaluators</p>
<p><strong>S: <u>S</u>killed</strong> at discerning according to purpose,
audience, context, and culture (PACC)</p>
<p><strong>E: <u>E</u>xperts</strong> at distinguishing fact from falsehood</p>
<p><strong>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; Creative inquirers</strong> explore and evaluate
real-world issues and multiple perspectives, as well as gather and synthesise
information from diverse print, non-print, and digital sources.</p>
<p>Therefore, Oasians are inquirers as they:</p>
<p><strong>I: <u>I</u>nvestigate</strong> real-world issues and multiple perspectives</p>
<p><strong>N: <u>N</u>avigate</strong> diverse print, non-print, and digital
sources</p>
<p><strong>Q: <u>Q</u>uestion</strong> and critically assessing information</p>
<p><strong>U: <u>U</u>tilise </strong>gathered information effectively</p>
<p><strong>I: <u>I</u>ntegrate</strong> knowledge from various sources</p>

<p><strong>E: <u>E</u>xplore</strong> solutions through collaboration</p>
<p><strong>R: <u>R</u>esolve</strong> challenges in familiar or new contexts</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach:</strong>
</p>
<p>Oasians will establish a strong foundation in the English language through
experiences of <strong>Discovery</strong>, <strong>Imagination</strong>,
and <strong>Change-making</strong>. These experiences will enable students
to apply their knowledge, skills, and demonstrate their learning by using
the language effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Oasis Learning Experience and Literature is Alive</strong>

</div>
<p>For our Primary 3 and 4 students, literature lessons are designed to awaken
their emotions and pique their sense of wonder. During OLE Week, the interdisciplinary
approach taken is more focused on the learning experience than outcomes,
and is tailored to be age-appropriate.</p>
<p>These literature lessons are crafted to instill a sense of ownership in
students' learning. Students' literary growth is promoted through reading,
reflecting, and re-evaluating their responses as they share perspectives
in group discussions. Through spoken and written forms, they are given
opportunities to articulate their thoughts, reflections, and experiences
of a literary work, and explain how an author makes a story effective.
They then apply their learning through assigned tasks, presentations, or
Values-In-Action projects.</p>

</div>
<p>Primary 3 students explore the literature text "Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory," where they learn how to overcome challenges they may face. They
gain hands-on experience working in groups to design prototypes such as
chocolate bars and chocolate bar wrappers. They then participate in activities
that allow them to reflect on and share their experiences of overcoming
personal challenges.</p>

</div>
<p>Primary 4 students explore the literature text "Wonder," where they learn
to appreciate those who may not think, look, or act the same way as they
do. They also learn about being empathetic, accepting differences, and
celebrating diversity. Students learn to put themselves in others’ shoes
and extend respect and appreciation.</p>

<p>During OLE Week, our Primary 5 students explore Media Literacy as part
of the school-based curriculum. This develops our students as discerners
of information in media and as skillful creators of information and media
messages. It also fosters creative thinking in our students.</p>
