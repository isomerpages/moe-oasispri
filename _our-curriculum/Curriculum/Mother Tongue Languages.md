<h3>Department Goals</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To develop pupils to be proficient and confident in their command of the
Mother Tongue Language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To inculcate pupils’ love and passion for their own native culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To instill moral values and civic-mindedness in our students</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The MTL department key approach to make learning MTL fun &amp; applicable
to real-life is through the application of E3 pedagogical approach which
are mainly Engagement, Experiential &amp; Empowerment to better support
the students’ learning in MTL.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong>&nbsp;is an important learning condition for
deep and meaningful learning. Through the use of ICT tools, pupils are
engaged and actively involved in the learning activities. At the same time,
assessment for learning strategies are also incorporated in these learning
activities to engage pupils and provide support for their learning.</p>
<p>To make learning MTL fun and applicable to real-life,&nbsp;<strong>experiential</strong>&nbsp;learning
is carried out through placed-based learning whereby pupils are provided
with opportunities to learn MTL in a fun way.</p>
<p>Pupils are&nbsp;<strong>empowered</strong>&nbsp;to take ownership of their
learning and become self-directed learners. During the learning process,
pupils are involved in decision-making and also to view mistakes as learning
opportunities.</p>

<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p><strong>Reading-Is-Fun Programme (RIF)</strong>
</p>
<p>To develop our students to be avid readers and cultivate their passion
in reading MTL storybooks, we embarked on our “RIF” journey.</p>
<p>Students who are passionate in reading MTL storybooks are selected to
be our <strong>Mother Tongue Language Ambassadors (LAs)</strong>. Trainings
were provided to equip the LAs with necessary skills to promote reading
to their peers in OPS. They participated in different activities such as <strong>Oasis</strong>  <strong>Booktopia</strong>,
book talks and storytelling sessions to encourage their peers to read more
MTL storybooks.</p>
<p>Students participate in Reading Superman, Reading Bingo and book reviews
in the classroom and at home to arouse their interest in reading MTL storybooks. <strong>Reading badges</strong> and
small tokens are awarded to the avid readers to motivate students to explore
in the world of books. Students also enjoy reading their MTL storybooks
during MTL library visits and Morning Assembly on Thursdays and Fridays.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 4 Chinese Language Young Journalism Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Chinese Language department started our own Oasian Young Journalism
Programme in 2022. This enrichment programme aims to cultivate the selected
Primary 4 group of students to develop their observational, writing, photography
and presentation skills, and uncover inspiring and interesting school news
in the Oasis Community. Through the programme, young journalists learn
how to draft interview questions, acquire the flow on an effective interview,
conduct interviews and edit videos. The activities aim to help them learn
how to listen, express and organise their thoughts on the go. Our students
have become more confident in communication skills through conducting interviews
with their peers during Mother Tongue Fortnight in April. They will also
have a chance to interview visiting parents during Open House in July,
which will encourage the young journalists to better appreciate the relevance
of language learning in the real world.Do stay tune for our upcoming news
production!</p>
