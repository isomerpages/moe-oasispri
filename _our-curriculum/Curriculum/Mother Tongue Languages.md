<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>The MTL department key approach to make learning MTL fun &amp; applicable
to real-life is through the application of E3 pedagogical approach which
are mainly Engagement, Experiential &amp; Empowerment to better support
the students’ learning in MTL.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong>&nbsp;is an important learning condition for
deep and meaningful learning. Through the use of ICT tools, pupils are
engaged and actively involved in the learning activities. At the same time,
assessment for learning strategies are also incorporated in these learning
activities to engage pupils and provide support for their learning.</p>
<p>To make learning MTL fun and applicable to real-life,&nbsp;<strong>experiential</strong>&nbsp;learning
is carried out through placed-based learning whereby pupils are provided
with opportunities to learn MTL in a fun way.</p>
<p>Pupils are&nbsp;<strong>empowered</strong>&nbsp;to take ownership of their
learning and become self-directed learners. During the learning process,
pupils are involved in decision-making and also to view mistakes as learning
opportunities.</p>
