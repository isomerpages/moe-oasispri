### Department Goals

*   To develop pupils to be proficient and confident in their command of the Mother Tongue Language
*   To inculcate pupils’ love and passion for their own native culture
*   To instill moral values and civic-mindedness in our students

### Our Approach

The MTL department key approach to make learning MTL fun &amp; applicable to real-life is through the application of E3 pedagogical approach which are mainly Engagement, Experiential &amp; Empowerment to better support the students’ learning in MTL.

**Engagement**&nbsp;is an important learning condition for deep and meaningful learning. Through the use of ICT tools, pupils are engaged and actively involved in the learning activities. At the same time, assessment for learning strategies are also incorporated in these learning activities to engage pupils and provide support for their learning.

To make learning MTL fun and applicable to real-life,&nbsp;**experiential**&nbsp;learning is carried out through placed-based learning whereby pupils are provided with opportunities to learn MTL in a fun way.

Pupils are&nbsp;**empowered**&nbsp;to take ownership of their learning and become self-directed learners. During the learning process, pupils are involved in decision-making and also to view mistakes as learning opportunities.

### Key Programmes

**Reading-Is-Fun Programme (RIF)**  

To develop our students to be avid readers and cultivate their passion in reading MTL storybooks, we embarked on our “RIF” journey.

In collaboration with the English department, we also plan programmes and activities, such as Oasis Book Day, for students to be immersed in a reading environment. Competitions held during Oasis Book Day were well received by students. Positive reading experiences are provided through book talks and storytelling sessions conducted by the Chinese Language ambassadors. Incentives such as Reading badges are awarded to the avid readers to motivate them to explore in the world of books.
