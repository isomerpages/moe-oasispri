<center><b>Inquisitive and scientifically literate citizens</center></b>

### Department Goals

To fuel a spirit of curiosity in our students to help them grow and become scientifically literate citizens in the world and for the world.

### Our Approach

     style="width:50%">
		 
Aligned to MOE’s direction, our Science curriculum seeks to enable students to see Science as meaningful and useful. Through the curriculum, the spirit of scientific inquiry will be inculcated. The conduct of inquiry will be founded on these three integral domains of (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes, which are essential to the practice of science. Students will explore issues and questions that are related to the roles played by science in daily life, society and the environment.

  

Teaching and learning of science through inquiry approach. Our teachers make use of multiple representations as visual stimuli to engage students in activities and processes to study the natural and physical world around them. To provide support for the students with the literacy demands of their science lessons, teachers adopt a three-stage framework: Observe, Link and Connect.

### Key Programmes

**I.C.E. @ Recess (Inquiry. Curiosity. Exploration)**

  

In line with our Unique Oasis Learning Experiences on Discovery, the I.C.E. @ Recess provides a platform for students to discover Science through inquiry-based and student-centred learning. Through explorations and experiments, students extend their understanding of science around them in their daily life. They also develop confidence communicating their ideas with others.

  

I.C.E. @ Recess is also a platform for students to develop their facilitation and leadership skills.

**Place-based Learning at Garden Sanctuary**

**1. Garden Sanctuary Trail (P3)**

Leveraging the power of place-based learning, we extend the learning of plants beyond classroom teaching. At Oasis Garden Sanctuary, students use mobile microscopes and iPads to collect and compare specimens of different plant parts. The students have to work collaboratively in groups to complete the Trail activities.

**2. Investigating factors affecting the environment (P6)**

P6 students investigating the temperature and light of the environment in the garden that affects the survival of the organisms living there. Using the data loggers, the students used the sensors to gather the data for their discussion.

**Place-based Learning - Sustainable Singapore Story**  

  

Place-based Learning in Oasis incorporates inquiry activities, which enable students to pose questions and investigate problems based in real-world contexts.

Many students find inquiry approaches to learning engaging, drawing them into study of questions they find personally interesting. Development of inquiry skills enhances critical thinking, intellectual growth, and students’ ability to take responsibility for their own learning.

The murals focus on Singapore’s Sustainable Story, which provide information about a different aspect of sustainability in Singapore.

**Toy Project (P3)**

Students apply their knowledge of the properties of different materials to create a toy for themselves. In this project, students learn to choose and use the most appropriate recyclable materials to design and make their toys. Students also learn the value of synergy in working as a team.

**Vermicomposting Enrichment Programme (P4)**

Students take a hands-on approach to learn how they can turn daily kitchen waste into organic fertilisers for plants. They are also given some insights on the biology of earthworms and the conditions required to expedite composting.

### Joy of Learning Science

### Achievements

**School**  

  

Oasis Primary School had attain BCA Green Mark GoldPlus, the highest so far for existing schools for the year 2020. The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has worked closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to develop the new BCA Green Mark for Existing Schools, which places stronger emphasis on raising the awareness amongst students and educating our future generation on the importance of environmental sustainability and conservation.

  

Therefore, Oasis Primary School’s Green Environmental Committee has an important role in leading by example through immediate action to bring awareness on environmental causes and impact to the Oasis community. With the support of OPS’s school leaders and their recommendation, the committee is committed to bring awareness of the green environmental messages. Now is the moment to act.
