<center><b>A community of self-directed learners and future-ready, responsible digital citizens</b></center>

### Department Goals

To develop proficient and responsible users of technology through a quality ICT-based total curriculum and learner-centric environment.

### Our Approach

**Building an ICT Enriched Learning Environment**

Undergirding quality learning with ICT is a set of future-ready, scalable, and reliable infrastructure in every school. In addition to 3 computer laboratories in the school, full-feature laptops in mobile carts, Chromebooks and iPads are available for use in teaching and learning anywhere in the school. The learning environment at Oasis also extends beyond the physical one to include the virtual space. Virtual learning spaces open up new opportunities for learning and offer rich learning resources and information, allowing students to learn beyond the confines of the classrooms and textbooks.

**Engaging Staff in Professional Development**

In an increasingly complex and volatile world, our students need to be equipped with the skills to navigate, collaborate and connect in the digital world.

Our teachers play an important role to achieve this by designing personalised learning experiences and environments that harness ICT to engage our students. Through professional development and mentoring, teachers continually deepen their understanding of e-Pedagogy and the effective use of ICT tools. Platforms are created for teachers to engage in professional discourse, learn, reflect and explore together, deepen their practice and hone their craft.

**Integrating Technology to support Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment**

In alignment with MOE ICT Masterplan 4, we aim to innovatively integrate ICT usage into curriculum, pedagogy and assessment to deepen subject mastery and develop 21st Century Competencies. Learning with technology in Oasis is guided by the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) and MOE SLS Pedagogical Scaffold (SLSPS), where teachers design meaningful ICT-enabled student-centric learning experiences to engage and respond to students’ learning. This helps to elevate pupils’ creativity, developing their digital and visual literacies by providing them with an appropriate blend of non-technological and online resources, extending their learning beyond the boundaries of school.

**Developing Responsible Users of Technology**  

The Cyber Wellness (CW) programme in Oasis aims to raise awareness and equip students with the understanding of how to behave online and enable them take responsibility of their well-being in cyberspace.

Cyber wellness lessons are taught via the weekly Form Teachers' Guidance Period (FTGP). This is in addition to the integrated teaching of cyber wellness in Character and Citizenship Education and academic subjects when appropriate.

  

In Oasis, together with the Student Leadership Committee, we develop a group of students as Cyber Wellness Ambassadors and empower them in promoting positive cyber culture in school. They champion cyber wellness through various platforms to promote positive online experiences among fellow students.

### Key Programmes

**Baseline ICT Lessons and Code for Fun**  

In order to prepare our students to be future-ready leaders, our ICT curriculum aims to equip all students with the knowledge, skills and attitudes for self-directed and collaborative learning through the effective and responsible use of ICT. Our structured ICT lessons complement our school’s curriculum and are designed to provide Oasians with an authentic setting to work on and tap on their learning content from the different subjects as a springboard to challenge them to more innovative learning experiences.

Throughout their education in Oasis Primary School, our pupils will acquire a wide repertoire of New Media Literacy Skills such as curating digital information and conducting accurate information searches online as well as honing their ICT skills such as Microsoft Office Skills and basic video editing.

In addition, the Primary 6 students are involved in the Code for Fun Primary Programme as part of their Post-PSLE activity. It is a collaboration between IMDA and MOE to introduce students to Computational Thinking, Coding, Robotics and Emerging Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). It aims to excite young students about the new opportunities in the digital economy and also serves as a baseline for students before they enter secondary school. Through this programme, students will:

*   learn about core computational thinking concepts and how it can be applied to aspects of daily life;  
    
*   understand basic programming concepts such as debugging, events, loops, variables, functions and conditionals;
*   develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills by breaking down problems into bite-sizes through mini-challenges and
*   be introduced to emerging technologies such as AI concepts such as what is Machine Learning, why are Data Sets important and how AI is used in decision making.

**Oasis Cyber Pals**

Our Lifelong Learning Programme, Lead With A Heart, Changemakers For The Future, focuses on building the character of the students through harnessing leadership qualities in every child. The ICT Department provides training for ICT Monitors once per semester as part of the student leadership training programme. Two pupils per class are identified to be ICT Monitors. During the training, they learn about the good qualities of an ICT Monitor and how they can assist the teacher to set up ICT equipment in the classroom. They also learn how to do simple trouble shooting skills. Through the training, they develop confidence in managing ICT-related tasks and build their advocacy skills to positively influence their peers to observe good netiquette online.  

**Innovation Journey**

As our students navigate the VUCA landscape, the need to possess the relevant mindset and skills in the domains of problem solving, collaboration and technological literacy become increasingly important.

The school’s efforts to build up Innovation Quotient in our students is demonstrated through the devotion of physical spaces around the school. To foster their imagination, the school has designed a total of six learning stations spanning across Levels 6 and 7, with the themes of ‘Hall of Fame’ and ‘House of Design’ respectively. The first wall mural on Famous Inventors was just installed in November 2020 and the Innovation Team continually harness their collective experiences to create a truly rich and authentic learning environment that transmits the love and excitement for learning and the drive to motivate Oasians to innovate.

The learning stations are as follows:

Place-based Learning at these two levels aims to take our students through a journey of understanding the process of innovation and support innovation by embracing the makers’ culture. It will create an environment conducive to creative endeavors, hands-on learning experiences, and connections with the outside world through learning. At the end of the journey, the student should be able to go about innovating ideas independently, unleash their creativity and turning ideas into reality.
