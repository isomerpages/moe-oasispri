<center><b>SHINE Oasians: Serve with a Heart and Inspire Everyone through words and actions</b></center>

### Department Goals

**Nurture our students to be good individuals and contributing citizens of Singapore through the teaching of values and the 7 habits of The Leader in Me (TLiM) programme, as well as developing of Socio-Emotional competencies.**

### Our Approach

**Character Development**

The CCE department customises and delivers the different components of CCE (comprising CCE lessons, Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons, school-based CCE and CCE Guidance Modules) to provide the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to be taught to our students. Oasians are also encouraged to put values into practice within the context of real-life situations in the family, school, community, nation and the world through their Values-In-Action projects.

**Citizenship Education**

Citizenship education nurtures our Oasians to develop dispositions towards national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instill in them the confidence in Singapore’s future. In addition to Social Studies lessons, citizenship education is also conducted through commemorative events such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, termly discussions through our NE bulletin news as well as learning journeys.

**Student Leadership**

As the school’s Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP), our student leadership programme aims to nurture our Oasians to be leaders who serve and lead with empathy, and contribute positively to the community through the following tiers:

		1.  Self-Leadership
		2.  Team Leadership
		3.  Change Leadership

### Key Programmes

![](/images/key%20programmes%201.png)

##### **P1 VIA - Be Gracious@Recess**

‘Be Gracious@Recess’, our VIA programme for Primary 1 aims to imbue good habits and table etiquette in our Oasians. They will be taught to practice personal hygiene by first washing their hands before taking their meals in the canteen. They are also encouraged to reduce food wastage, return their cutlery and conduct wipe down of the table after eating.

Two Gracious Ambassadors are appointed from each P1 class to remind their classmates to be Gracious@Recess. Students are encouraged to be responsible in keeping their tables and floor clean. The classes will be assessed on the cleanliness of the tables and the floor assigned and certificates are issued to classes to reaffirm the students’ effort.

##### **P2 VIA - Happy Toilet**  

‘Happy Toilet’, our VIA programme for Primary 2 aims to nurture socially responsible students who practise good toilet habits with Integrity . Students are ‘caught doing right’, organised with the intention of encouraging and affirming them. A checklist is also displayed in the toilet to remind students to practise good toilet habits such as flushing the toilets after use and washing their hands with soap in the basin.

In collaboration with the Student Development Team, all P2 students will pen notes of gratitude to the cleaners for their hard work in washing and keeping the toilets clean every day. They will also write thank you notes, which are framed and presented to the school cleaners.

##### **P3 VIA - Cyber Champ**

 With students’ wellbeing in mind, the P3 VIA programme titled ‘Cyber Champ’ works towards promoting good habits in using technology and showing respect to self and others. After learning about Cyber Wellness during school assemblies, the P3 students are tasked to encourage Oasians to be a responsible and safe digital user, as well as a positive influence to their peers. This involves them getting into groups to discuss and create board games for play at recess.

##### **P4 VIA - By My Friend**
  
One of the VIA programmes for Primary 4 students is titled ‘Be My Buddy’, and they will play an important role as a buddy to our P1 students in the first week of the academic year. This includes the preparation of a “Welcome” card for their P1 buddy and it is presented to them at recess. They will also guide their P1 buddy to buy food and clear their plates after eating.

...

Another VIA programme for our Primary 4 students is titled “Friendship Project” and this marks the fifth year of our collaboration with Pathlight School. Through our school’s English literature programme, P4 Oasians have the opportunity to forge friendships with students from Pathlight School through letter writing as well as interact with them in person through school visits.

##### **P5 VIA - Green Oasians**

“Green Oasians” is the VIA programme for P5 students and this is done in partnership with the English Department and as part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP). Through this programme, P5 Oasians embark on a journey to care for the environment and they will also visit the Sustainable Singapore Wall in the school (as part of Place-Based Learning) to understand about the environmental efforts undertaken by Singapore to promote environmental sustainability.

To further strengthen the advocacy on caring for the environment and harmony in nature, the P5 students will also design and create posters advocating ‘green’ messages. Physical posters and e-posters are also showcased and students will also conduct presentation to their peers.

##### **Social Studies in Oasis**

Social Studies (SS) in Oasis Primary is aligned to the national curriculum and seeks to develop students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world we live in.

Our students’ learning is based on three broad clusters, as reflected in the SS syllabus:

##### **NE Bulletin Discussion Lessons**

In addition to the formal SS curriculum, Oasians engage in classroom discussions about contemporary issues through NE Bulletin Discussion Lessons. These lessons are conducted with the aim of getting students to be more informed citizens who are aware of what is happening around them. Oasians also participate in classroom discussions where they share their thoughts, ideas and beliefs about the contemporary issues raised.

##### **Place-based Learning**

Place-Based Learning is also part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary School.

Primary 2, 3 and 4 students will visit the mural walls on Storey 3 (Our Heritage Trail) to learn more about the different communities in Singapore, Singapore’s past and how our founding fathers have contributed to the independence of Singapore.

P6 Students will visit the mural walls on Storey 5 (Oasis Global Explorer) to learn more about the sustainable goals of the United Nations through a gamified experience. The experience supports the teaching and learning of SS lessons, focusing on the theme of ‘Sustainability’. It is aligned with the third cluster of study in SS, ‘Appreciating Singapore, the Region and the World We Live in”, where students learn about the diverse and global physical environment in the world they live in.

<img src="/images/cce_photo1c.PNG" style="width:100%">

##### **Learning Journeys**

Each year, our students will also go on field-based learning journeys out of school as part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary School. Through these learning journeys, our students develop important skills and acquire knowledge from the environment that they have explored and learn to be more informed citizens who are aware of what is happening around them.

##### **Commemorating Total Defence Day**

Schools commemorate Total Defence Day (TDD) on 15 February annually to mark Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in 1942. TDD serves to remind our students that Singapore is defensible and we must defend Singapore ourselves. Total Defense has guided us through many difficult times, most recently, through our nation’s fight against COVID-19.

This year, the theme of the Total Defence campaign "Together We Keep Singapore Strong" focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.&nbsp; It highlights the importance in rallying Singaporeans together to overcome crisis. The focus this year is on food security and the six pillars of defense.

One of the highlights of commemorating TDD this year was the in-house skit put together by the teachers. The skitaimed to spread the messages of reducing food wastage and not to fall prey to scams. In addition, our students also participated in the various recess activities to understand how Singapore continues to have a constant supply of food for our people during difficult times.

##### **International Friendship Day**  

International Friendship Day (IFD) celebrates the cultural diversities in ASEAN and the connection Singapore shares with her neighboring countries and beyond.

The theme for this year’s IFD is ‘Singapore in Asia’. Through this theme, we had the opportunity for students to be acquainted with the diverse and colorful culture and traditions of countries in Asia. It was a special event as our friends and teachers did a fashion parade to showcase the different traditional attires found in Asia.

Our Primary 6 students also participated in an inter-class costume design competition, where they were tasked to design an IFD costume that best represents Singapore in ASEAN or Asia.

Students also learnt that Singapore builds strong friendship bonds with her neighbors in Southeast Asia, therefore nurturing and inculcating among the students the spirit of friendship and collaboration with their peers.

##### **Racial Harmony Day**

The theme for Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2022 was “Our Multicultural Mosaic”. We commemorated the event with a series of activities that helped our students to better appreciate the diversity and uniqueness of our society. This included having our teachers and students donning the four major ethnic communities’ attires and playing traditional games that our parents and grandparents once played when they were young.

It was interesting to find out during the Assembly sharing that some places in Singapore are known to be streets of harmony. These places are known for having significant places of worship from different beliefs and religions on the same street.

Students were also introduced to people of different races and religions living together as neighbours in a HDB flat, the most common form of houses in Singapore. Together, Singaporeans learn to live in harmony with one another, and they even celebrated the different festivals from the ethnic communities in Singapore, as part of our multicultural mosaic heritage.

##### **National Day Celebrations**

As Singapore continued to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Oasians found a way to commemorate National Day (ND) differently in 2022. Our students rose to the occasion to put up a splendid performance for their fellow schoolmates under the guidance of our teachers. We had our first march-in contingent, consisting of Scouts and Prefects, to bring in the National and School flags during the Observance Ceremony. Other students from various CCAs like Wushu, Dance and Guzheng also showcased their talents through their performances.

To mark the special occasion, all students and staff of the Oasis family participated in a lock-down activity where they learnt to be prepared at all times. It was an enriching programme. We ended the celebration on a high note with the NDP 2022 theme song and evergreen favourites such as “Home” that all Singaporeans are familiar with. These songs resonated with our students because they reflect the changes of the nation and sentiment of the people. Stronger Together, Majulah!

##### **Cyber Wellness**

Aimed at raising an Oasian who is a positive influence, responsible and safe digital user, customized programmes such as differentiated assemblies were conducted to bring across age-appropriate messages to our students.

Oasians were also involved in the creation of our first Cyber Singa mascot. During one of the assembly programmes, the creator was given the opportunity to share his inspiration and hopes for his peers. This mascot was also used during recess activity and the peers were thrilled to be receiving bookmark reminders from the mascot.

##### **Conducive Classroom Award**
##### 

The school wishes to inculcate care and responsibility in Oasians where they take ownership of their classroom cleanliness and create a conducive learning environment. To this end, a team of teachers from the Character Development would visit the classes to affirm the cleanliness of each class by stamping stars on the Conducive Classroom Award chart displayed outside every classroom.

In addition, the “Use Your Hands Campaign” is also conducted at the end of each semester before the students go for their vacations. This is to instill in Oasians a sense of responsibility and pride in taking care of their learning environment.

Empowerment is given to Peer Support Leaders to create a positive environment for their classmates by using the YOLO space to paste fun and inspiring messages.

##### **Peer Support Leaders Training**

Strong peer support relationships help to create a caring and enabling environment where each child feels safe, respected and accepted. To champion this effort, a group of students are appointed as Peer Support Leaders. The Peer Support Leaders go through training with prosocial skills so that they can support their peers through peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing.

With the tagline, “Always Here For You”, our Peer Support Leaders navigate their role actively through completion of tasks in their mission cards.
