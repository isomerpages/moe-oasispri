<center><b>SHINE Oasians: Serve with a Heart and Inspire Everyone through words and actions</b></center>

### Department Goals

**Nurture our students to be good individuals and contributing citizens of Singapore through the teaching of values and the 7 habits of The Leader in Me (TLiM) programme, as well as developing of Socio-Emotional competencies.**

### Our Approach

**Character Development**

The CCE department customises and delivers the different components of CCE (comprising CCE lessons, Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons, school-based CCE and CCE Guidance Modules) to provide the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to be taught to our students. Oasians are also encouraged to put values into practice within the context of real-life situations in the family, school, community, nation and the world through their Values-In-Action projects.

**Citizenship Education**

Citizenship education nurtures our Oasians to develop dispositions towards national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instill in them the confidence in Singapore’s future. In addition to Social Studies lessons, citizenship education is also conducted through commemorative events such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, termly discussions through our NE bulletin news as well as learning journeys.

**Student Leadership**

As the school’s Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP), our student leadership programme aims to nurture our Oasians to be leaders who serve and lead with empathy, and contribute positively to the community through the following tiers:

		1.  Self-Leadership
		2.  Team Leadership
		3.  Change Leadership

### Key Programmes

![](/images/key%20programmes%201.png)

**P1 VIA - Be Gracious@Recess**

The P1 VIA, Be Gracious@Recess aims to imbue good habits and table etiquette in the canteen. Students observe personal hygiene by first washing their hands before taking their meals. They return the cutlery, followed by wipe down of the table after eating. Then they sanitise their hands and put on their mask.

Two Gracious Ambassadors are appointed from each P1 class to remind their classmates to be Gracious@Recess. Students are encouraged to be responsible in keeping their tables and floor clean.&nbsp; A panel of teachers comprising of the Year Head, SH/ Character Development, SH/NESS and teacher-in-charge of P1 VIA will assess the cleanliness of the tables and the floor assigned to each class. Certificates for gold or silver awards are issued to reaffirm the students’ effort of BE Gracious@Recess.

**P2 VIA - Happy Toilet**  

P2 VIA aims to nurture socially responsible students in practising good toilet habits with Integrity (which is also the value level focus of P2) behind closed doors. Through the process, they learn and apply the learning and application of the values of Care, Respect and Responsibility too.  

The Primary 2 students also showed appreciation to our school cleaners in recognition of their hard work especially during this pandemic time. Students and teachers worked together to design a piece of artwork. It was a tree filled with love and thanks before presenting them to the cleaners. In collaboration with the SDT team, the students also penned down their thoughts to show gratitude to the cleaners.

**P3 VIA - Be My Buddy**

The P3 students played an important role as a buddy to our P1 students in the first week of this year. Despite the challenges of Covid-19 social distancing measures, they managed to meet each other in zoom in the first week. The P3 students even prepared a “Welcome” card for the P1 students.

In Term 2, the P3 students wrote a “Hello” note to inquire of the P1 students’ well-being after a term in Oasis Primary School. They had an opportunity to meet face-to-face in the school hall when social distancing measure was lifted up. It was a wonderful moment for both parties to meet finally!

**P4 VIA - The Friendship Project**
  
This is the fourth year we are collaborating with Pathlight School&nbsp;for ‘The Friendship Project’. The objective of this VIA is for students to be able to empathise and show care for others.

![](/images/P4%20VIA.png)

In collaboration with the English Department, Oasis students learnt what autism is during their ‘P4 Literature is Alive’, an Applied Learning Programme (ALP). Then they learnt what a pen pal is and how to correspond with them in writing. Finally, a zoom session was arranged for the pen pals to meet and interact with one another.

**P5 VIA - Green Oasians**

In partnership with English Department and Applied Learning Programme (ALP), P5 students attended more than six lessons on Media Literacy.

Through place-based learning, they also visited the Sustainable Singapore Wall at level 5 in the school where they learned about the environmental measures that Singapore has carried out.

To further strengthen the advocacy on caring for the environment and harmony in nature, the P5&nbsp;designed and created posters with green messages. Physical posters and e-posters are showcased in P1 and P2 classes, in the foyer and on school-wide broadcasting platforms.

**P6 VIA - Be A Blessing**  

Our P6 students had the opportunity to reach out to residents of Peacehaven Nursing Home.&nbsp; Through the VIA, they learnt to be grateful for what they have. The objective of the VIA is for students to put together a ‘Blessing’ care package for the residents. In 2021, they prepared 450 care packages of food items. They contributed food items as well. They designed and wrote well wishes on cards which were given in each care package. The students found the project meaningful and engaging.

##### **Social Studies in Oasis**

Social Studies (SS) in Oasis Primary is aligned to the national curriculum and seeks to develop students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world we live in.

Our students’ learning is based on three broad clusters, as reflected in the SS syllabus:

##### **NE Bulletin Discussion Lessons**

In addition to the formal SS curriculum, Oasians engage in classroom discussions about contemporary issues through NE Bulletin Discussion Lessons. These lessons are conducted with the aim of getting students to be more informed citizens who are aware of what is happening around them. Oasians also participate in classroom discussions where they share their thoughts, ideas and beliefs about the contemporary issues raised.

##### **Place-based Learning**

Place-Based Learning is also part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary School.

Primary 2, 3 and 4 students will visit the mural walls on Storey 3 (Our Heritage Trail) to learn more about the different communities in Singapore, Singapore’s past and how our founding fathers have contributed to the independence of Singapore.

P6 Students will visit the mural walls on Storey 5 (Oasis Global Explorer) to learn more about the sustainable goals of the United Nations through a gamified experience. The experience supports the teaching and learning of SS lessons, focusing on the theme of ‘Sustainability’. It is aligned with the third cluster of study in SS, ‘Appreciating Singapore, the Region and the World We Live in”, where students learn about the diverse and global physical environment in the world they live in.

<img src="/images/cce_photo1c.PNG" style="width:100%">

##### **Learning Journeys**

Each year, our students will also go on field-based learning journeys out of school as part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary School. Through these learning journeys, our students develop important skills and acquire knowledge from the environment that they have explored and learn to be more informed citizens who are aware of what is happening around them.

##### **Commemorating Total Defence Day**

Schools commemorate Total Defence Day (TDD) on 15 February annually to mark Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in 1942. TDD serves to remind our students that Singapore is defensible and we must defend Singapore ourselves. Total Defense has guided us through many difficult times, most recently, through our nation’s fight against COVID-19.

This year, the theme of the Total Defence campaign "Together We Keep Singapore Strong" focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives.&nbsp; It highlights the importance in rallying Singaporeans together to overcome crisis. The focus this year is on food security and the six pillars of defense.

One of the highlights of commemorating TDD this year was the in-house skit put together by the teachers. The skitaimed to spread the messages of reducing food wastage and not to fall prey to scams. In addition, our students also participated in the various recess activities to understand how Singapore continues to have a constant supply of food for our people during difficult times.

**International Friendship Day**  

The theme for International Friendship Day this year is ‘Singapore in Asia. Through this theme, our students recognised the importance of connectedness within Asia, therefore nurturing and inculcating among the students the spirit of friendship and collaboration with their peers.  

In line with Cambodia’s chairmanship 2022, students learnt the Cambodian cultural practices and mode of transportation. Our teachers also shared about their overseas experiences within Asia. This provided a good opportunity for students to be acquainted with the diverse and interesting cultures and traditions of Asia.

**Racial Harmony Day**

The theme for Racial Harmony Day 2021 was “Common Spaces, Connected Communities”. Here at Oasis, we commemorated the event with a series of engaging activities. Teachers and students came dressed in colourful, vibrant ethnic costumes that showcased the multiculturalism we share here in Singapore.

During the assembly talk, students learnt that shared spaces help connect all of us. These common spaces also allow different ethnicities to learn more about each other in areas such as food, religion and arts. Students also participated collectively in creating a collage that displayed their understanding of the theme and their desire to commit to building a more caring, cohesive and resilient nation.

**National Day Celebrations**

In view of the COVID-19 situation, Oasians commemorates National Day in a special way. The Observance Ceremony took on a special significance as students reflected on how far Singapore has come in our fight against COVID-19. The theme “Together, Our Singapore Spirit” celebrates Singaporeans’ unity and can-do spirit that has kept our country strong amid the pandemic.

The ceremony began with the raising of the National flag and a 'Recollections' segment, where students reflected on past and present challenges faced by our country and how each of us has a part to play in building a stronger Singapore. This was followed by a celebration segment “Our Colourful Food Culture through P2 Art Showcase &amp; Classroom Engagement Activity”. Students also watched a play about embracing our differences and participated in the National Day Quiz on Singapore. We ended the celebration on a high note with the NDP 2021 theme song and some old favourites such as “Count On Me, Singapore”, “We Are Singapore” and “Home” that all Singaporeans are familiar with. These songs resonated with our students because they reflect the changes of the nation and sentiment of the people.

**Cyber Wellness**

Cyber Wellness Programme aims to educate stakeholders with digital literacy. Oasis Cyber Wellness framework is Assess, Champion and Empower. We assess students’ online habits and experiences through survey. The team champions cyber wellness messages to students, staff and parents through various platforms such as Student Learning Spaces, Class Dojo and school’s TV Broadcast. Cyber Wellness programme aims to empower students, staff and parents to promote positive cyber culture in school as well as at home.

**Conducive Classroom Award**

In partnership with the school cleaning vendor, the cleaners would visit the classes to affirm the cleanliness of each class by stamping stars on the class cleanliness chart displayed outside every classroom. At the end of each term, the Gold, Silver or Bronze Award will be presented to classes based on the number of stamps they have accumulated in each term.

From the above programme, the school wishes to inculcate care and responsibility in Oasians where they take ownership their classrooms’ conducive environment.

The “Use Your Hands Campaign” is also carried out at the end of each semester before the students go for their mid-year and end-of-year vacations. This is to instill in Oasians a sense of responsibility and pride in their learning environment.

**Model Students for Term 1 &amp; Term 2, 2022**

The Model Student award is a termly award to recognise students’ effort in living up to the school value &amp; the 7 habits. Every teacher provides the input in nominating students who deserve the award. In Term 1, we have the model student for the school value of Responsibility and Habit 1: Be Proactive and Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind. In Term 2, we have the model student for the school value of Respect and Integrity with Habit 3: Put First Things First and Habit 4: Think Win-Win.

### Peer Support Leaders Training

Strong peer support relationships help to create a caring and enabling environment where each child feels safe, respected and accepted. To champion this effort, a group of students are appointed as Peer Support Leaders. The Peer Support Leaders go through training with prosocial skills so that they can support their peers through peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing.

With the tagline, “Always Here For You”, our Peer Support Leaders navigate their role actively through completion of tasks in their mission cards.
