<p><strong>SHINE Oasians: Serve with a Heart and Inspire Everyone through words and actions</strong>
</p>
<h3><strong>Department Goals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Nurture our students to be good individuals and contributing citizens of Singapore through the teaching of values and the 7 habits of The Leader in Me (TLiM) programme, as well as developing of Socio-Emotional competencies.</strong>
</p>
<h3><strong>Our Approach</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Character Development</strong></h5>
<p>The CCE department customises and delivers the different components of
CCE (comprising CCE lessons, Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons, school-based
CCE and CCE Guidance Modules) to provide the knowledge, skills, values
and attitudes to be taught to our students. Oasians are also encouraged
to put values into practice within the context of real-life situations
in the family, school, community, nation and the world through their Values-In-Action
projects.</p>
<h5><strong>Citizenship Education</strong></h5>
<p>Citizenship education nurtures our Oasians to develop dispositions towards
national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and
instill in them the confidence in Singapore’s future. In addition to Social
Studies lessons, citizenship education is also conducted through commemorative
events such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial
Harmony Day and National Day, termly discussions through our NE bulletin
news as well as learning journeys.</p>
<h5><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h5>
<p>As the school’s Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP), our student leadership
programme aims to nurture our Oasians to be leaders who serve and lead
with empathy, and contribute positively to the community through the following
tiers:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Self- Leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team Leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Leadership</p>

</ol>
