On top of social studies lessons, citizenship education is also conducted through the commemorative events, termly discussion on NE bulletin news as well as learning journeys.

**P1 VIA - Be Gracious@Recess**

The P1 VIA, Be Gracious@Recess aims to imbue good habits and table etiquette in the canteen. Students observe personal hygiene by first washing their hands before taking their meals. They return the cutlery, followed by wipe down of the table after eating. Then they sanitise their hands and put on their mask.

  

Two Gracious Ambassadors are appointed from each P1 class to remind their classmates to be Gracious@Recess. Students are encouraged to be responsible in keeping their tables and floor clean.  A panel of teachers comprising of the Year Head, SH/ Character Development, SH/NESS and teacher-in-charge of P1 VIA will assess the cleanliness of the tables and the floor assigned to each class. Certificates for gold or silver awards are issued to reaffirm the students’ effort of BE Gracious@Recess.

**P2 VIA - Happy Toilet**  

P2 VIA aims to nurture socially responsible students in practising good toilet habits with Integrity (which is also the value level focus of P2) behind closed doors. Through the process, they learn and apply the learning and application of the values of Care, Respect and Responsibility too.  

The Primary 2 students also showed appreciation to our school cleaners in recognition of their hard work especially during this pandemic time. Students and teachers worked together to design a piece of artwork. It was a tree filled with love and thanks before presenting them to the cleaners. In collaboration with the SDT team, the students also penned down their thoughts to show gratitude to the cleaners.

**P3 VIA - Be My Buddy**

The P3 students played an important role as a buddy to our P1 students in the first week of this year. Despite the challenges of Covid-19 social distancing measures, they managed to meet each other in zoom in the first week. The P3 students even prepared a “Welcome” card for the P1 students.

In Term 2, the P3 students wrote a “Hello” note to inquire of the P1 students’ well-being after a term in Oasis Primary School. They had an opportunity to meet face-to-face in the school hall when social distancing measure was lifted up. It was a wonderful moment for both parties to meet finally!

In collaboration with the English Department, Oasis students learnt what autism is during their ‘P4 Literature is Alive’, an Applied Learning Programme (ALP). Then they learnt what a pen pal is and how to correspond with them in writing. Finally, a zoom session was arranged for the pen pals to meet and interact with one another.

**P5 VIA - Green Oasians**

In partnership with English Department and Applied Learning Programme (ALP), P5 students attended more than six lessons on Media Literacy.

  

Through place-based learning, they also visited the Sustainable Singapore Wall at level 5 in the school where they learned about the environmental measures that Singapore has carried out.

  

To further strengthen the advocacy on caring for the environment and harmony in nature, the P5 designed and created posters with green messages. Physical posters and e-posters are showcased in P1 and P2 classes, in the foyer and on school-wide broadcasting platforms.

**P6 VIA - Be A Blessing**  

Our P6 students had the opportunity to reach out to residents of Peacehaven Nursing Home.  Through the VIA, they learnt to be grateful for what they have. The objective of the VIA is for students to put together a ‘Blessing’ care package for the residents. In 2021, they prepared 450 care packages of food items. They contributed food items as well. They designed and wrote well wishes on cards which were given in each care package. The students found the project meaningful and engaging.
