<center><b>Eloquent and effective communicators in a media-rich environment</b></center>

### Department Goals

To develop Oasians to be:

*   **Empathetic communicators** who possess the values, dispositions and skills to listen actively to different perspectives, communicate confidently, effectively and sensitively while collaborating with others to work towards shared goals.
*   **Discerning readers** who possess broad worldviews by staying well informed and self-directed in the use of information, and are able to distinguish fact from falsehood by processing and evaluating information critically.
*   **Creative inquirers** who explore and evaluate real-world issues and multiple perspectives as well as gather and synthesize information from diverse print, non-print and digital sources.
		 
### Our Approach

Here at Oasis, we want to focus on the enjoyment of language as students formally learn the metalanguage and grammatical items associated with texts. There will be systematic and explicit instruction of grammar, with a focus on word, phrase and sentence level grammar before a gradual incorporation of text level grammar.


We also emphasised on learning-focused interaction at class and group levels. Teachers provide opportunities for students to learn and use language appropriately and meaningfully in a wide variety of contexts according to purpose, audience, context and culture.

Teachers will help students achieve effective use of English through exposing students to information-rich content and texts with increasing sophistication and complexity from multiple print, non-print and digital networked sources thus developing critical literacy skills in our students.
