<p>Social Studies (SS) in Oasis Primary is aligned to the national curriculum
and seeks to develop students to be informed, concerned and participative
citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute
responsibly to the society and world we live in.</p>
<p>Our students’ learning is based on three broad clusters, as reflected
in the SS syllabus:</p>

<h4><strong>Learning Journeys</strong></h4>
<p>Each year, our students will also go on field-based learning journeys
out of school as part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary School. Through
these learning journeys, our students develop important skills and acquire
knowledge from the environment that they have explored and learn to be
more informed citizens who are aware of what is happening around them.</p>

<p>In addition to the formal SS curriculum, Oasians engage in classroom discussions
about contemporary issues through NE Bulletin Discussion Lessons. These
lessons are conducted with the aim of getting students to be more informed
citizens who are aware of what is happening around them. Oasians also participate
in classroom discussions where they share their thoughts, ideas and beliefs
about the contemporary issues raised.</p>

<p><strong>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Place-based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Place-Based Learning is also part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary
School.</p>
<p>Primary 2, 3 and 4 students will visit the mural walls on Storey 3 (Our
Heritage Trail) to learn more about the different communities in Singapore,
Singapore’s past and how our founding fathers have contributed to the independence
of Singapore.</p>
<p>P6 Students will visit the mural walls on Storey 5 (Oasis Global Explorer)
to learn more about the sustainable goals of the United Nations through
a gamified experience. The experience supports the teaching and learning
of SS lessons, focusing on the theme of ‘Sustainability’. It is aligned
with the third cluster of study in SS, ‘Appreciating Singapore, the Region
and the World We Live in”, where students learn about the diverse and global
physical environment in the world they live in.</p>
