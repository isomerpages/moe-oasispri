<p>Social Studies (SS) in Oasis Primary is aligned to the national curriculum
and seeks to develop students to be informed, concerned and participative
citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute
responsibly to the society and world we live in.</p>
<p>Our students’ learning is based on three broad clusters, as reflected
in the SS syllabus:</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>Each year, our students will also go on field-based learning journeys
out of school as part of the SS curriculum in Oasis Primary School. Through
these learning journeys, our students develop important skills and acquire
knowledge from the environment that they have explored and learn to be
more informed citizens who are aware of what is happening around them.</p>
