<h4><strong>On-going Transition to P1 Programme in MK@Oasis</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>The transition from preschool to primary school is one of the largest and most important changes children have to encounter &amp; manage at that age.</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Fabian &amp; Dunlop, 2006</em>
</p>
<p>A successful transition to Primary 1 has a positive impact on the children's
academic performance, social and emotional development. Children who are
adequately equipped with the skills to adapt to a new environment, will
be able to ease into their primary school more quickly. The sooner they
adapt, the better their school and learning experience will be.</p>
<p>In our MK, we start to nurture the children holistically from Day 1 of
their kindergarten journey so that they are confident, demonstrate strong
social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>In addition, our team collaborates with parents and primary school educators
in smoothening and easing the childrenâ€™s transition.</p>
<p>Towards the end of K2, the preparation becomes more deliberate. This includes
doing activities such as visiting of primary school classrooms and participating
in planned (structured) activities and routines.</p>

(<strong><em>MK</em></strong>) curriculum supports children in their transition
to Primary&nbsp;<strong><em>1</em></strong>&nbsp;(P1).</p>
