<p>YMCA KCARE @OASIS aims to provide a safe and conducive environment for
children to play, explore and discover the world around them.</p>
<p>We help to build your child’s sense of self-worth and help him/her develop
at his/her own pace.&nbsp; Through our programme and activities, we nurture
each child to reach his/her maximum potential.</p>
<p>Children will be given the opportunity to have a variety of experiences
and develop skills, dispositions and values through their play and exploration.&nbsp;
These include confidence, social skills, self-help skills and values such
as responsibility, care and respect.</p>
<p>The YMCA KCare@Oasis team is led by an experienced and caring supervisor
who is now in her seventh year at the centre. The team consists of 14 staff
members, including 6 Programme Staff, 3 Support Staff, 2 Cleaners, 1 Administrative
Assistant, and the Centre Supervisor. We incorporate the values of the
One YMCA Culture—Encourage, Empower, and Excellence—into our daily practices
and interactions with both adults and children. Our goal is to provide
committed, competent, and passionate care for your child.</p>
