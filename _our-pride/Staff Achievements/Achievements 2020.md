Congratulations to Mr. Desmond Lim on being selected as one of the recipients for the Outstanding Youth in Education Award (OYEA) 2020!

The OYEA is a national award that recognises and honours the achievements of young educators who have a passion and commitment to teaching, inspiring and nurturing their students. Launched in 1999, it seeks to recognise excellent younger teachers for their youthful idealism, enthusiasm, energy and active involvement in the development of youth beyond the formal curriculum.

“I see teaching as a highly creative endeavour. I believe we should embrace the notion of teachers as artists. An artist has a fresh view and an open mind, looks at things from various perspectives. Being an artist gives one freedom to do things differently. An artist is not afraid to do something new. He or she looks for inspiration in all kinds of experiences.

Moving forward in these extraordinary times, I would like to seize the creative side of teaching so that I can become more effective as I reach out to students and promote holistic learning.”
