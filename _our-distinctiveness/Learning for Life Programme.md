### Learning For Life Programme - ‘Lead With A Heart, Changemakers For The Future’

Oasis Primary School leverages on ‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for The Future’ to live out its mission. ‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for The Future’ – Our learning for life programme (LLP) focuses on building the character of the students through harnessing leadership qualities in every child. At the fundamental level, the school believes that every student can be a leader – being able to lead oneself both in words and actions. Our LLP is grounded on the timeless and universal concepts and principles of ‘The Leader in Me’, based on the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. The teaching of these habits leads to transformational changes in how individuals manage self and work with others.  

‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for The Future’ further creates many learning experiences as student take up the different student leadership roles that would require them to work with their peers and the community. Through the LLP, Student Leaders will be trained in Emphatic leadership and Design Thinking which will put them in good stead to take up projects contributing to the betterment of the school and community. The Student Leaders being proactive and motivated will also be proficient in initiating level and school-wide projects.

More importantly, the school aims to develop leaders who inspire all to lead with a heart guided by the school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony (R3ICH values). Through the student’s initiated projects and other purposefully designed activities, our students learn to be Active Contributor and Concerned Citizens.

### Start It Right! Programme

Oasians welcomed 2022 with our signature programme, Start It Right! Each programme was designed to meet the needs of each level. The objectives of these programmes were

* Self-management

* Student Leadership - The Leader in Me

* Strengthening Teacher-student and Student-student Relationships

* Safe and Conducive Learning Environment

* School Wide Positive Behaviour&nbsp;

The Year Heads gave a Zoom talk for the respective levels where they welcomed the students back to school and set the school’s expectations. Together with their form teachers, the students planned their S.M.A.R.T goals and set targets for their SHINE@Oasis. Besides that, the students also decorated their classrooms together.

The students enjoyed the programme tremendously. They looked forward to school and were ready for 2022.

### End It Well! Programme

The school was full of bustle and excitement on the second last day of school. All students from the six levels participated in ‘End It Well!’ Programme and tremendously enjoyed themselves. During the ‘Sharpen the Saw’ segment, besides revisiting the 7 Habits, students also relooked at their goals for the year. Some levels set S.M.A.R.T goals while others learn more about the Growth Mindset.  

Everybody participated in the English Language segment of the ‘End It Well!’ Programme. The series of activities were planned for all the students to challenge themselves, synergise and collaborate with their peers. The lower primary students were involved in the ‘Stories Come Alive!’ while the middle primary students took part in ‘Wonka’s Mystery Box Challenge’ and ‘Wonder Escape Room (Virtual)’. The upper primary students immersed themselves in the ‘Mad World of Media’.

To end the day, the whole school synergised to clean up their classrooms during ‘Use Your Hands’ segment. Everybody was enthusiastic and looked forward to leave a clean classroom for the next batch. It was truly a day that ended well.

##### **TLiM Lessons &amp; TLiM Place-Based Learning**

To develop Tier 1 self-leadership in all students, the school engages students in the learning of 7 Habits through The Leader In Me (TLiM) lessons. TLiM empowers students with leadership and life skills they need to thrive in life.

Primary 1 and Primary 2 students also undergo TLiM Placed-Based Learning at the school’s TLiM pillars to strengthen their understanding of the 7 habits through interactive activities and manipulatives.

##### TLiM Celebrations

During TLiM Celebrations, students will carry out various activities to consolidate the learning of the 7 Habits in The Leader in Me at the end of each year.

Some of the past TLiM Celebration activities include:

Primary 1 students practising Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind by stringing macaroni beads into a bracelet of a desired design. They also practised Habit 6: Synergize to solve a puzzle on the iPad with their peers.

Primary 2 students incorporated the 7 Habits to modify a lyric of a song of their choice. In the process of modifying the lyrics, students are also encouraged to demonstrate the 7 Habits.

Primary 3 students were engaged in Comic Strip making to practise Habit 3: Put First Things First and Habit 4: Think Win-Win as they complete the assigned task. Students were also given a chance to view their peers’ masterpieces in a Gallery Walk.

Primary 4 students applied Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood and Habit 6: Synergize to plan and demonstrate activities to promote an Inclusive Oasis. Students were given a chance to try out the activities planned by their peers from other classes.

##### Role Specific Training For Tier 2 Student Leaders

At Oasis Primary, we believe that every student has the potential to develop leadership skills, and the training of leadership skills should be intentional.

Therefore, the Student Leadership Committee works closely with various departments to conduct role specific training once a semester to equip Tier 2 classroom leaders with the necessary skills to carry out their duties.

##### P3 Prefects Changemaker Project 2022 - Memory Box

Our P3 prefects decided to do a project to show appreciation towards their teachers in school. The prefects brainstormed the type of gifts to present to their teachers. After initiating a short survey with teachers to understand their needs, they decided to create memory boxes for the teachers, for them to keep thank you gifts, cards and notes from students, which will bring back fond memories in time to come. The prefects felt a sense of achievement and satisfaction as they were able to show appreciation to their teachers through the gifts that they prepared and presented

**P5 &amp; P6 Sub-area 2 Prefects Changemaker Project - Renew, Refresh, Reinvent**

Students of Oasis Primary School noticed that food packaging goes to waste after food is being consumed it is thrown at a rapid speed and this leads to large volume of waste accumulated every day.

Our sub-area 2 prefects decided to create instructional video to teach on how to upcycle, and hold level competitions to motivate their peers to start upcycling.

The team put together a SLS toolkit that consist of various instructional videos to educate Oasians on the impact of food packaging waste on the environment, as well as demonstrate ways on upcycling everyday food packaging waste. This helped students to increase their awareness and encourage positive steps to take in upcycling food packaging. Parents were very supportive of the project and many of them worked together with their children to create upcycled items to participate in the level competition.

This project clinched the Gold Award in the National Youth Upcycling Movement 2021.

**P5 &amp; P6 Sub-area 3 Prefects Changemaker Project -Secret Mail &amp; A Dose of Laughter**

To encourage school mates to be positive and resilient when they are experiencing new norms during the pandemic, and to help them beat stress, our sub-area 3 prefects came out with the idea of having a secret mail channel for school mates to write about their problems. The prefects also prepared a set of jokes video with their family as "Dose Of Laughters" segment in SLS for all students to view and have their mood lighten during the HBL period.  

This project received special mention during the 12th&nbsp;Design For Change Singapore Challenge 2021.
