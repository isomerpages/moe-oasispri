### Learning For Life Programme - ‘Lead With A Heart, Changemakers For The Future’

Oasis Primary School leverages on ‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for The Future’ to live out its mission. ‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for The Future’ – Our learning for life programme (LLP) focuses on building the character of the students through harnessing leadership qualities in every child. At the fundamental level, the school believes that every student can be a leader – being able to lead oneself both in words and actions. Our LLP is grounded on the timeless and universal concepts and principles of ‘The Leader in Me’, based on the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. The teaching of these habits leads to transformational changes in how individuals manage self and work with others.  

‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for The Future’ further creates many learning experiences as student take up the different student leadership roles that would require them to work with their peers and the community. Through the LLP, Student Leaders will be trained in Emphatic leadership and Design Thinking which will put them in good stead to take up projects contributing to the betterment of the school and community. The Student Leaders being proactive and motivated will also be proficient in initiating level and school-wide projects.

More importantly, the school aims to develop leaders who inspire all to lead with a heart guided by the school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony (R3ICH values). Through the student’s initiated projects and other purposefully designed activities, our students learn to be Active Contributor and Concerned Citizens.

**P5 &amp; P6 Sub-area 1 Prefects Changemaker Project - Fake Or Real**

Technology becomes part of our lives as society progresses and people are exposed to fake news every day. Fake news regarding Covid 19 were being circulated and such circulation affected parents, students and even staff members. This motivates the P5 &amp; P6 Prefects in wanting to help others to learn how to differentiate fake news from real news. The team created a video toolkit with an online game to educate Oasians about fake news. Level competitions were held for P3, P4 and P6 students to challenge schoolmates to design creative taglines, jingles and raps to remind others to guard against fake news. The level competitions received overwhelming responses from students. This project clinched the Silver Award in the National Cyberwelless Advocacy Challenge and the Top 3 Award in the 12th&nbsp;Design For Change Singapore Challenge 2021.

**P5 &amp; P6 Sub-area 2 Prefects Changemaker Project - Renew, Refresh, Reinvent**

Students of Oasis Primary School noticed that food packaging goes to waste after food is being consumed it is thrown at a rapid speed and this leads to large volume of waste accumulated every day.

Our sub-area 2 prefects decided to create instructional video to teach on how to upcycle, and hold level competitions to motivate their peers to start upcycling.

The team put together a SLS toolkit that consist of various instructional videos to educate Oasians on the impact of food packaging waste on the environment, as well as demonstrate ways on upcycling everyday food packaging waste. This helped students to increase their awareness and encourage positive steps to take in upcycling food packaging. Parents were very supportive of the project and many of them worked together with their children to create upcycled items to participate in the level competition.

This project clinched the Gold Award in the National Youth Upcycling Movement 2021.

The prefects also prepared a set of jokes video with their family as "Dose Of Laughters" segment in SLS for all students to view and have their mood lighten during the HBL period.
