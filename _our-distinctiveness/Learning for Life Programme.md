<h4><strong>Learning For Life Programme - ‘Lead With A Heart, Changemakers For The Future’</strong></h4>
<p>Oasis Primary School leverages on ‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for
The Future’ to live out its mission. ‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for
The Future’ - Our learning for life programme (LLP) focuses on building
the character of the students through harnessing leadership qualities in
every child. At the fundamental level, the school believes that every student
can be a leader - being able to lead oneself both in words and actions.
Our LLP is grounded on the timeless and universal concepts and principles
of ‘The Leader in Me’, based on the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.
The teaching of these habits leads to transformational changes in how individuals
manage self and work with others.</p>
<p>‘Lead with a Heart, Changemakers for The Future’ further creates many
learning experiences as student take up the different student leadership
roles that would require them to work with their peers and the community.
Through the LLP, Student Leaders will be trained in Emphatic leadership
and Design Thinking which will put them in good stead to take up projects
contributing to the betterment of the school and community. The Student
Leaders being proactive and motivated will also be proficient in initiating
level and school-wide projects.</p>
<p>More importantly, the school aims to develop leaders who inspire all to
lead with a heart guided by the school values of Respect, Responsibility,
Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony (R3ICH values). Through the student’s
initiated projects and other purposefully designed activities, our students
learn to be Active Contributor and Concerned Citizens.</p>

<h5><strong>End It Well! Programme</strong></h5>
<p>The school was full of bustle and excitement on the second last day of
school. All students from the six levels participated in ‘End It Well!’
Programme and tremendously enjoyed themselves. During the ‘Sharpen the
Saw’ segment, besides revisiting the 7 Habits, students also relooked at
their goals for the year. Some levels set S.M.A.R.T goals while others
learn more about the Growth Mindset.</p>
<p>Everybody participated in the English Language segment of the ‘End It
Well!’ Programme. The series of activities were planned for all the students
to challenge themselves, synergise and collaborate with their peers. The
lower primary students were involved in the ‘Stories Come Alive!’ while
the middle primary students took part in ‘Wonka’s Mystery Box Challenge’
and ‘Wonder Escape Room (Virtual)’. The upper primary students immersed
themselves in the ‘Mad World of Media’.</p>

<h5><strong>TLiM Celebrations</strong></h5>
<p>During TLiM Celebrations, students will carry out various activities to
consolidate the learning of the 7 Habits in The Leader in Me at the end
of each year.</p>
<p>Some of the past TLiM Celebration activities include:</p>
<p>Primary 1 students practising Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind by stringing
macaroni beads into a bracelet of a desired design. They also practised
Habit 6: Synergize to solve a puzzle on the iPad with their peers.</p>
<p>Primary 2 students incorporated the 7 Habits to modify a lyric of a song
of their choice. In the process of modifying the lyrics, students are also
encouraged to demonstrate the 7 Habits.</p>
<p>Primary 3 students were engaged in Comic Strip making to practise Habit
3: Put First Things First and Habit 4: Think Win-Win as they complete the
assigned task. Students were also given a chance to view their peers’ masterpieces
in a Gallery Walk.</p>
<p>Primary 4 students applied Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, then to
be Understood and Habit 6: Synergize to plan and demonstrate activities

<h5><strong>Role Specific Training For Tier 2 Student Leaders</strong></h5>

leadership skills, and the training of leadership skills should be intentional.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Student Leadership Committee works closely with various
departments to conduct role specific training once a semester to equip
Tier 2 classroom leaders with the necessary skills to carry out their duties.</p>

<h5>P5 &amp; P6 Sub-area 1 Prefects Changemaker Project - Burst The Bubbles!</h5>
<p>Technology becomes part of our lives as society progresses and people
are exposed to real and unreal information every day. This motivates the
P5 &amp; P6 Prefects in wanting to help others to learn about the algorithm
of search engines, and how to avoid filter bubbles so as to avoid unreal
information online. The team created a video toolkit with an online game
to educate fellow schoolmates. Level competitions were held for P3, P4
and P6 students to challenge schoolmates to participate in colouring contest,
poster-making and comic-creation competition, to remind others to guard
against unreal information. This project clinched the Silver Award in the
National Cyberwellness Advocacy Challenge 2022.</p>

<h5>P5 &amp; P6 Sub-area 2 Prefects Changemaker Project - I Am An Upcyclist!</h5>
<p>Our students noticed that single-use plastic items go to waste after food
or products are consumed. Plastic waste is thrown at a rapid speed and
this leads to large volume of plastic waste accumulated every day.</p>
<p>Our sub-area 2 prefects decided to create instructional video to teach
on how to upcycle, and hold level competitions to motivate their peers
to start upcycling.</p>
<p>The team put together a SLS toolkit that consist of various instructional
videos to educate their schoolmates on the impact of plastic waste on the
environment, as well as demonstrate ways on upcycling everyday plastic
waste. This helped students increase their awareness and encourage positive
steps to take in upcycling plastic packaging. Parents were very supportive
of the project and many of them worked together with their children to
create upcycled items to participate in the level competition.</p>
<p>This project clinched the Silver Award in the National Youth Upcycling
Movement 2022, and prefect representatives were also involved to present
their project experience at the 13th Be The Change Celebration.</p>
