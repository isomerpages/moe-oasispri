### The Unique Oasis Learning Experiences

The school has thoughtfully designed its curriculum, physical space and environment to pique students’ spirit of inquisitiveness, harness creative and critical thinking and create platforms for innovative contributions. These experiences of Discovery, Imagination and Changemaking undergird the T & L implementation processes and structures. More importantly, they aim to foster joyful, meaningful and engaged learning in fulfilling the school’s vision of nurturing Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders. Some examples are Speech and Drama Programme for EL and MT, Math Around Us, Literature is Alive, Health Funanza, school camps and Student Leadership programmes.
