<p>Place-based Learning is a school-wide pedagogical approach that leverages
on the Power of Place to create exploratory, meaningful and immersive learning
for the students, anytime and anywhere. It capitalises on the school’s
physical structure, community landscapes and together with the affordance
of technology; facilitates enriched and collaborative learning for students
to make connections within the school community and beyond. It also promotes
student agency that engages them with the community through inquiry and
authentic learning experiences.</p>
<p>Placed-based Learning is grounded within three phases – school, neighbourhood
and community.</p>
