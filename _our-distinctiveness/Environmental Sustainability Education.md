Place-based Learning in Oasis incorporates inquiry activities, which enables students to pose questions and investigate problems based in real-world contexts.

Many students find inquiry approaches to learning engaging, drawing them into study of questions they find personally interesting. Development of inquiry skills enhances critical thinking, intellectual growth, and students’ ability to take responsibility for their own learning.

This wall mural on Storey 5 focuses on Singapore’s Sustainable Story, which provides information about different aspects of sustainability in Singapore.

Subject integration in English and Science has allowed for an effective engagement of students in investigation of Science while utilising English as an effective communicative tool.
